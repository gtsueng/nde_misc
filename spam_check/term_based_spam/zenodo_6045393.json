    "description": "This data set contains 12\u00a0smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) dump files that were used to produce some of the figures in the journal paper:\n\n\nBate, Matthew. R., 2022, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, accepted 13 May\u00a02022\n\n\nEach of the SPH dump files is from a different calculation of the early stages of star formation: the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core, including dust coagulation. \u00a0Each SPH dump file gives the state of the SPH calculation when the maximum temperature reached 1500 K, except for the beta=0.05 cases which give the state when the maximum hydrogen number density reaches 10^{14} cm^{-3}. \u00a0The calculations were each performed using 3 million SPH particles and differed by their initial rotation rate, which was parameterised by beta=0, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05 (the magnitude of the ratio of the rotational and gravitational potential energies). \u00a0Dump files from calculations that include and exclude envelope turbulence are provided (both are used for Figure B1). \u00a0The dump files associated with each calculation are:\n\n\nbeta=0: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0B1M0123\u00a0(does not include envelope turbulence)\nbeta=0.0025: B1M2123\u00a0(does not include envelope turbulence)\nbeta=0.005: \u00a0B1M5123\u00a0(does not include envelope turbulence)\nbeta=0.01: \u00a0 B1M1128\u00a0(does not include envelope turbulence)\nbeta=0.02: \u00a0 B1M2126\u00a0(does not include envelope turbulence)\nbeta=0.05: \u00a0 B1M5109_b05_NoEnvTurb\u00a0(does not include envelope turbulence)\n\n\nbeta=0.0: \u00a0 \u00a0B1M0123_b0_EnvTurb\nbeta=0.0025: B1M2177_b0025_EnvTurb\nbeta=0.005: \u00a0B1M5209_b005_EnvTurb\nbeta=0.01: \u00a0 B1M1219_b01_EnvTurb\nbeta=0.02: \u00a0 B1M2221_b02_EnvTurb\nbeta=0.05: \u00a0 B1M5321_b05_EnvTurb\n\n\nThe SPH dump files are Fortran binary files written in big endian format and generated by the sphNG code (Benz 1990;\u00a0Bate 1995; Bate & Keto 2015). They can be read, visualised, and manipulated using the free, publicly available SPLASH visualisation code (which reads sphNG dump files), written by Daniel J. Price, that can be downloaded from:\u00a0\n\n\nhttp://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/splash/\u00a0\n\n\nThe SPLASH configuration files used to produce Figs. 10,11,12,and\u00a0B1 in Bate (2022) are included with this dataset in a gzipped tar file.\n\n\n\u00a0",
