This Genius Wave audio program purposefully enhances the theta activity in the brain to help improve overall cognitive function.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis audio track can help relax nerves and cells, due to the soothing sound waves travelling in the brain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Genius Wave audio tracks have been purchased by many customers. Almost every customer is pleased with the effectiveness of the soundwaves triggering mental enhancement. Customers suggest listening to the audio for a few hours a day to help the brain match the frequencies and adapt it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe recommend purchasing this complete audio track from the official website because it is the only platform that sells the authentic version of the program. It also comes with an additional money-back policy for customers who may not find this program effective.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat is the Working Process of the Genius Brain Wave?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Genius Brain Wave is the only soundwave developed to activate your God-given creative genius, ensuring you attract happiness and success. But where does the problem begin? Or why can\u2019t we seem to solve life\u2019s challenges easily?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe problems lie in your \u201cTheta Wave.\u201d This wave in your brain is responsible for attracting blessings and shaping your reality. According to the official website, this wave is active in kids and dormant in adults. This explains why most adults struggle to generate ideas, concentrate, and remember important details.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe good news is that \u201cTheta Wave\u201d can be activated anytime from the comfort of your own home. You can choose to meditate, wake up early, or use a biofeedback machine. But these methods take a lot of effort, time, and money. This is why we recommend the Genius Wave.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFinal Verdict: Is The Genius Wave Worth it?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBased on the scientific research, positive user experiences, and the credibility of its creator, Dr. James Rivers, The Genius Wave appears to be a promising brain entrainment program.
