    "description": "This serious borad-game was created within the SCD of the University of French Guiana by Marie Latour and Caroline Boiteux to ensure the understanding of the main principles of Open Access, and to start the debate on the challenges raised.\n\n\nA first version was first presented at the Bobcatsss symposium 2016, which was held at the ENSSIB, in Lyon, under the name \u201cSuper Open Librarian\u201d. It was presented by Myriam Gorsse (SCD at the Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris) and Guillemette Trognot (the \u201cMarie Curie\u201d Library of INSA, Lyon).\n\n\nA second version was then presented during the Open Access Week 2016, which was held in Cayenne, with the financial support of COUPERIN. For this event, a graphic designer, Jordy le Bruchec (Signarama, Cayenne, French Guiana), was hired to create the visuals. Two presentation sessions were organized in Cayenne for PhD students at the \u201cDiversities, health and development in Amazonia\u201d postgraduate school (University of French Guiana). This game was then included as part of the doctoral training offered each year by the SCD of the University of French Guiana and its PhD students. Other schools and universities then adopted it and tailored it for their events and own training courses: INSA - Lyon, Lilliad - Lille, Claude Bernard University (Lyon 1), etc. This French version is avaible at this address : https://zenodo.org/record/1409702#.XQ0RcutKjRY.\n\n\nIn 2019, this game was translated into English to be presented at the LIBER European Libraries congress. The professional traductor selected was Y.A.N.A Traduction (Cayenne, French Guiana).\n\n\nThe library of the University of French Guiana gives the opportunity to download the entire game to be able to use it freely and at no cost in your establishments. It is placed under the Creative Commons BY NC SA license, which allows its free re-use provided that the authors are cited and there is no commercial use. It is possible to modify the game: however, all modifications must be exclusively shared under the same license under which the initial game was placed. We would like to remind you that the removal of the logos of the University of French Guiana from the cards and game boards is strictly prohibited.\n\n\nInstitutions interested in buying a copy of the game are offered this possibility: besides the price of the game, which is made by our Guianese graphic provider Signarama, a fixed price of \u20ac30 per game must be paid to the University of French Guiana. This amount will be reinvested in the creation of new educational and enjoyable products, which will be shared with the community !\u00a0",
