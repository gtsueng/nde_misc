    "description": "Model description: Digital outcrop model of the 788 m high Meyerfjellet peak. It is located on the peninsula between Ekmanfjorden and Dicksonfjorden, and is wedged between Kapitolbreen and Meyerbreen. The peak is made up of a doleritic intrusion, not previously mapped. The intrusion belongs to the Diabasodden Suite, which represents the High Arctic Large Igneous Province on Svalbard. The intrusion is emplaced at the contact between the Gipshuken Formation and the Kapp Starostin Formation. The western side appears more snow-covered, as those images were taken a few days before the photos of the eastern side, when the snow had largely melted away.Data availability:All uploaded archives are to be extracted to the same directory for a functional working environment, i.e., at the very least consisting of a project folder with the data and metashape subdirectories. The included processing report specifies the processing parameters that were used as input for the processing software (Agisoft Metashape, v1.7.1.11797).Exported model data use CRS epsg:32633.Show and visualise on Svalbox.no:Through Svalbox we aim to take geoscientific research and education to the next level \u2013 with the simple motto of placing all key information and data sets in their correct spatial position. We bring modern technology, in particular cost-effective digital outcrops, to complement more than 200 years of geoscientific research on Svalbard. Finally, Svalbox provides a sustainable platform for sharing results, workflows and teaching material with the wider geoscientific community.For more information, contact the Svalbox team at svalbox[at]gmail.com.",
