    "description": "Model description: The Kampesteindalen Fault is a normal fault striking roughly NW-SE and dipping approximately 70 degrees to the SW (Smyrak-Sikora et al., 2019). With an offset of approximately 50 metres, the fault juxtaposes the uppermost Hultberget Formation against the Ebbaelva Member of the Ebbadalen Formation.Data availability:All uploaded archives are to be extracted to the same directory for a functional working environment, i.e., at the very least consisting of a project folder with the data and metashape subdirectories. The included processing report specifies the processing parameters that were used as input for the processing software (Agisoft Metashape, v1.7.2.12040).Exported model data use CRS epsg:32633.Show and visualise on Svalbox.no:Through Svalbox we aim to take geoscientific research and education to the next level \u2013 with the simple motto of placing all key information and data sets in their correct spatial position. We bring modern technology, in particular cost-effective digital outcrops, to complement more than 200 years of geoscientific research on Svalbard. Finally, Svalbox provides a sustainable platform for sharing results, workflows and teaching material with the wider geoscientific community.For more information, contact the Svalbox team at svalbox[at]gmail.com.",
