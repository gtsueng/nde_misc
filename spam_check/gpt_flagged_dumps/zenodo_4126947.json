    "description": "We proudly present you the IMDB show ontology. This is an ontology based on IMDB data and geocoded locations data for many scenes for shows which previously was not available in a single dataset. The present ontology is extensively documented in our GitHub repository:\u00a0https://github.com/AlexHoorn/group51-kdd Relations are aligned with foaf and schema ontologies and every show is explicitly aligned with wikidata via a Owl:sameAs predicate.\n\n\nFor the contents and structure of this ontology we would kindly refer you here:\u00a0https://github.com/AlexHoorn/MovieLocationsOntology\n\n\nFor the creation and data in this ontology we would kindly refer you here:\u00a0https://github.com/AlexHoorn/MovieLocationsOntology/tree/main/data\n\n\nWe highly recommended you to visit our movie location app to explore this data.\u00a0",
