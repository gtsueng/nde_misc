    "description": "This dataset includes\u00a0First Street's aggregated flood risk summary statistics. The data is available in CSV format and is aggregated at the congressional district, county, and zip code level. The data allows you to\u00a0compare FSF data with FEMA data. You\u00a0can also view aggregated flood risk statistics for various modeled return periods (5-, 100-, and 500-year) and see how risk changes due to climate change (compare\u00a0FSF 2020 and 2050 data).\u00a0There are various Flood Factor risk score aggregations available including the\u00a0average risk score for\u00a0all properties (flood factor risk scores 1-10) and the\u00a0average risk score for\u00a0properties with risk (i.e. flood factor risk scores of 2 or greater). This is version 1.3 of the data and it covers the 48 contiguous United States. There will be updated versions to follow.\n\n\nIf you are interested in acquiring First Street flood data, you can request to access the data here. More information on First Street's flood risk statistics can be found here and information on First Street's hazards can be found\u00a0here.",
