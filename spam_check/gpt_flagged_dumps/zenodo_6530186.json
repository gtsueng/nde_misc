The inclusion of these data in the Spatial Scaling Challenge is at the discretion of the participants.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe SPATIAL SCALING CHALLENGE aims at gathering the community\u2019s expertise and knowledge to tackle the scaling problems posed by variables of different nature. These experiences will be summarized in a journal article where all the participants are invited to contribute. The exercise is internationally open. Ph.D. students, early career and senior researchers, spin-offs, and companies working in the field of remote sensing of vegetation ecophysiology are welcome to participate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSTILL OPEN FOR PARTICIPATION! New deadline\u00a031st\u00a0of October 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFollow all the communications and updates of the SPATIAL SCALING CHALLENGE\u00a0in the RG site:\u00a0https://www.researchgate.net/project/Spatial-Scaling-Challenge-COST-Action-CA17134-SENSECO-Working-Group-1.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0",
