mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences on Washington Ae. aegypti samples and samples from potential sources to
 further narrow the origin of this population. Genetically, Washington Ae. aegypti are closest to populations in
Florida, meaning this is the most likely source. Florida experienced the first mosquito-borne transmission of dengue
in the United States after decades of absence of this disease, as well as local transmission of chikungunya and Zika
in recent years. This indicates that the Capitol Hill, Washington, DC population of Ae. aegypti is capable of
 transmitting viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in modern US city environments.",isolates,N/A,,,,

Male members of the subgenus Avaritia were identified to species level based on their genital morphology, whilst females were treated as a single group and sub-divided according to the appearance of their abdomen (unpigmented, pigmented, gravid and blood-fed). Development of pigmentation in female Culicoides is broadly indicative of aging, but direct extrapolation to parity is not recommended. For larger samples, a subsampling technique was used. 17 trapping sites are georeferenced to the county level. In most cases, there was a single trap per county.

To overcome these constraints, the advantages of a machine learning framework combined with an iterative optimization process to develop a method for integrating genetic and environmental data. Here, this method is validated and demonstrated for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, an invasive species and the primary vector of dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika.  A map of genetic connectivity is produced for Ae. aegypti's range in North America and discuss which environmental and anthropogenic variables are most important for predicting gene flow, especially in the context of vector control.

A cascade of genes with hierarchical regulation characterizes sex determination pathways in insects.  How such pathways evolve is poorly understood, partly due to a lack of comparative data. Houseflies are well known for their polymorphic sex determination with populations carrying a dominant male determiner M on the Y chromosome or any of the five autosomes. We identified the male determining gene Mdm responsible for splicing regulation of the key switch transformer by exploiting the existence of housefly populations with different sex determination mechanisms. We demonstrate that Mdm originated from duplication of CWC22/nucampholin, a generic and essential splicing regulator across Metazoans with a crucial role in exon-junction complex assembly and non-sense mediated decay. We show that strains with the M-locus on the Y and on different autosomes carry multiple copies of Mdm indicating that the same male determiner translocated to different genomic sites in the genome. We found that embryonic RNAi-based silencing of Mdm leads to differentiation of ovaries in males, while targeted Mdm disruption with CRISPR/CAS-9 resulted in complete sex reversal to fertile females. Our study reveals how a duplicate of a gene with a general splice-regulation role during development can be recruited to serve a specific function in the determination of male sex. Mdm appears to be unique to the housefly representing a compelling example for the plasticity at the instructive level of sex determination hierarchies.",transcript_expression,N/A,,,,

WHO susceptibility tests showed this species has developed multiple resistance to insecticides in the study area. Anopheles funestus s.s. population in Akaka-Remo is highly resistant to organochlorines: dieldrin (8%) and DDT (10%). Resistance was also observed against pyrethroids: permethrin (68%) and deltamethrin (87%), and the carbamate bendiocarb (84%). Mortality rate with DDT slightly increased (from 10 to 30%, n = 45) after PBO pre-exposure indicating that cytochrome P450s play little role in DDT resistance while high mortalities were recorded after PBO pre-exposure with permethrin (from 68 to 100%, n = 70) and dieldrin (from 8 to 100%, n = 48) suggesting the implication of P450s in the observed permethrin and dieldrin resistance. High frequencies of resistant allele, 119F in F0 (77%) and F1 (80% in resistant and 72% in susceptible) populations with an odd ratio of 1.56 (P = 0.1859) show that L119F-GSTe2 mutation is almost fixed in the population. Genotyping of the A296S-RDL mutation in both F0 and F1 samples shows an association with dieldrin resistance with an odd ratio of 81 (P < 0.0001) (allelic frequency (R) = 76% for F0; for F1, 90 and 10% were observed in resistant and susceptible populations, respectively) as this mutation is not yet fixed in the population.

In natural environments, this hypoxia is generated by the consumption of oxygen by aerobically respiring microbes in the gut. This signal activates the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway leading to expression of response genes. To identify the genes that are induced or repressed by hypoxia, we indirectly activated or suppressed hypoxia by rearing mosquitoes with aerobic, wild-type E. coli (K12) or with E. coli encoding a defective cytochrome oxidase. We directly manipulated HIF signaling using pharmacological agents that activated or suppressed HIF signaling.

Mosquitoes were fed on mice infected with a clone of P. berghei strain pbANKA, expressing GFP under the hsp70 promoter at 5-10% parasitemia with mature gametocytes, gametocyte maturity was tested by exflagellation of microgametes. Mosquitoes were maintained at 21 C and 80% relative humidity on 10% sucrose. Pools of 30 An. gambiae Ngousso mosquito midguts 48h after P. berghei infected or control feeding were homogenized in TRIzol (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted by following standard manufacturer instructions.
Immunoprecipitation was performed on the extracted RNA using protein G agarose (Invitrogen) and anti-dsRNA antibody J2 (scicons). 3 conditions were performed: RNA from infected midguts and the J2 antibody; RNA from infected midguts and a  mouse IgG2a isotype control; RNA from uninfected midguts and the J2 antibody. Biological duplicates were performed. Bound RNA on the beads was extracted using TRIzol (Ambion).
Paired end librairies then were prepared using Paired end RNA Library reagents (Illumina).

Core components of the pathway are the Piwi clade Argonaute proteins and the associated small non-coding RNAs termed piRNAs. In this study, we set to investigate the evolutionary conservation of the piRNA pathway in Rhodnius prolixus, a primary insect vector of the Chagas disease. First, we identified the Rhodnius orthologs of the proteins that act in the biogenesis and function of the piRNAs in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster ovary. Then, we employed transcriptomic analyses using total RNA extracted from previtellogenic stages of of Rhodnius' oogenesis to determine their expression levels. Our study reveals that important enzymatic activities, including the three piwi orthologs (i.e. Rp-piwi2, Rp-piwi3 and Rp-ago3) and a vasa gene are expressed at substantial levels in Rhodnius ovaries. We also show the a fourth piwi ortholog, namely Rp-piwi1, is not expressed in early oogenesis and might be dispensable for Rhodnius adult female fertility. Finally, we unveil interesting differences between Drosophila and Rhodnius. For instance, the spnE gene, which is crucial for piRNA biogenesis in the fruit fly, is expressed at negligible levels in Rhodnius, where it might not be required for piRNA production. Our transcriptomic analyses also provide a full catalog of the genes expressed in Rhodnius ovaries and reveal that the current annotations of the Rhodnius genome do not fully reflect the actual structure and length of the transcripts expressed in this species. Thus, our study provides new insight in the evolution of the piRNA pathway and a valuable resource for future genomic and functional studies.",transcript_expression,N/A,,,,

Male members of the subgenus Avaritia were identified to species level based on their genital morphology, whilst females were treated as a single group and sub-divided according to the appearance of their abdomen (unpigmented, pigmented, gravid and blood-fed). Development of pigmentation in female Culicoides is broadly indicative of aging, but direct extrapolation to parity is not recommended.

The 7 samples (paired-end reads, including replicates ( 3 samples from Ag55 cells and 4 samples from blood-fed female adults downloaded from NCBI GEO (Series GSE55453, SRA id : SRP039058))) were independently mapped on to A. gambiae genome (Anopheles-gambiae-PEST_CHROMOSOMES_AgamP4.fa.gz) downloaded from vectorbase by using TopHat followed by Cufflinks to estimate the expression values of the transcripts in FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads) with the cuffdiff2 default geometric normalization. Differentially expressed genes (FDR&lt;0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple-testing) were identified for Ag55 cells relative to Blood fed female adults Results: We provide detailed gene expression and proteome profiles of Ag55 cells. We further compare the gene expression profiles of Ag55 cells and blood fed female adults. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of our transcriptomic data suggested that Ag55 cells have phagocytic properties, a hypothesis which we confirmed using confocal imaging. Transcriptomic data further backed by proteomic data suggest that Ag55 cells express hemocyte like properties, and are immune competent. Conclusion: As Ag55 cells are immune competent and express hemocyte like properties they can be used as a model to study vector-pathogen immune response. Furthermore, the availability of transcriptomic and proteomic data of Ag55 cells will help researchers use and engineer the Ag55 cell line in an efficient way, for example by developing strategies to make it more suitable for studies of interactions with Plasmodium and other microbes. Overall design: Gene expression profile of Ag55 cell line was generated by RNA-Seq, in triplicate, using  Illumina HiSeq 2000 v3 platform",transcript_expression,N/A,,,,

The infection process requires ~30 minutes and is highly complex as quiescent sporozoites injected with mosquito saliva must be rapidly activated in the skin, migrate through the body, and infect the liver. This process is poorly understood for Plasmodium vivax due to low infectivity in the in vitro models. To study this skin-to-liver stage of malaria, we developed quantitative bioassays coupled with transcriptomics to evaluate parasite changes linked with mammalian microenvironmental factors. Our in vitro phenotype and RNA-Seq analyses revealed key microenvironmental relationships with distinct biological functions. M ost notable, preservation of sporozoite quiescence by exposure to insect-like factors coupled with strategic activation limits untimely activation of invasion-associated genes to dramatically increase hepatocyte invasion rates. We also report the first transcriptomic analysis of the P. vivax sporozoite interaction in salivary glands identifying 118 infection-related differentially-regulated Anopheles dirus genes. These results provide important new insights in malaria parasite biology and identify priority targets for antimalarial therapeutic interventions to block P. vivax infection.",transcript_expression,N/A,,,,
