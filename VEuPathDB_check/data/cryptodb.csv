            Purified oocysts of <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> IowaII passaged in lambs were excysted. Freshly excysted 
            sporozoites were solubolized and protein preparations were analyzed by 2 dimensional electrophoresis 
            LC-MS/MS. Spectra were searched against a Cryptosporidium database using SEQUEST. SEQUEST results were 
            assembled and filtered using the DTASelect (version 2.0) program.","protein_expression","N/A"
