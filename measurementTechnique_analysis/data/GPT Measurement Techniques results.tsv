clinepidb_DS_010e5612b8	ClinEpiDB	WASH Benefits Kenya Cluster Randomized Trial	The WASH Benefits Study        Publications from the project can be found by clicking here  Related studies:   WASH Benefits Bangladesh Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE)    Background: During the first two years of life, children born in low-income countries       are at risk for enteric infections due to poor water quality, sanitation conditions, and caregiver handwashing       practices (WASH). During this period, children are also at risk for undernutrition.              Beyond the acute morbidity and suffering caused by enteric infections and undernutrition, observational evidence       also suggests that repeated infections alone and in combination with undernutrition in the first years of life can       have lasting and detrimental effects on longer-term physical growth, cognitive development, and adult human capital.              The WASH Benefits studies provides rigorous evidence on the health and developmental benefits of water quality,       sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions during the first years of life. A cluster-randomized controlled       trial measured the impact of intervention among newborn infants in rural Kenya. The study is large in scope       (> 7,000 newborns) and has eight arms (six treatment arms and two control arms). Primary outcomes were measured after       two years of intervention.             Objectives: The goal of the WASH Benefits studies is to generate rigorous evidence about the impacts of       sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and development in the first years of       life. The WASH Benefits Kenya study is highly comparable to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh study; both cluster randomized       trials investigated the effects of the same six treatment arms.           The study has three primary scientific objectives:  Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and         development after 2 years of intervention. Determine whether there are larger reductions in diarrhea when providing a combined water, sanitation and handwashing         intervention compared to each component alone. Determine whether there are larger effects on growth and development from combining a) daily supplemental nutrition         with b) a combined water, sanitation and handwashing intervention compared to each component alone.   The study has three secondary scientific objectives: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Measure the impact of nutritional supplements and household environmental interventions on environmental enteropathy         biomarkers, and more clearly elucidate this potential pathway between environmental interventions and child growth and development. Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing and nutritional interventions on intestinal parasitic infection         prevalence and intensity. Measure the association between parasitic infection and other measures of enteric health, including acute diarrhea and environmental         enteropathy biomarkers.   The tertiary scientific objective of the study was to measure the impact of interventions on the following outcomes: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Weight-for-age at 1 and 2 years Weight-for-height at 1 and 2 years Underweight at 2 years Wasting at 2 years Severe stunting at 2 years Head circumference-for-age at 1 year and 2 years Soil-transmitted helminth infection at 2 years Protozoan infection at 2 years Verbal Communicative Development Inventory at 1 year WHO motor milestones at 1 year Acute respiratory illness All cause mortality      Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The trial was conducted in rural areas of 10 districts in Bungoma, Kakamega and Vihiga counties in the western        part of Kenya. The region is populated mainly by subsistence farmers. Unimproved latrine coverage is high (at least 85%). A pilot study in the region       estimated that among children <27 months old, 11% had diarrhea in the preceding 2 days. Very few (<5%) households had piped water and the majority of households        reported obtaining drinking water from sources where chlorination has previously been shown to be effective (such as protected springs).         Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - May 2014         Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6 treatment arms, a passive control arm, and a double-sized active control arm. Pregnant women        were enrolled, and outcomes were assessed in the children following 12 and 24 months of intervention.         Eligibility Criteria: The study communities must have met the following criteria:         Rural communities (defined as villages with <25% of residents living in rental houses, <2 gas/petrol stations and <10 shops) Not enrolled in ongoing water, sanitation, hygiene, or nutrition programs Most of the population relied on communal water sources and had unimproved sanitation facilities At least six eligible pregnant women in the cluster at baseline    Study Arms: Clusters were randomized to one of 8 study arms. Intervention delivery occurred within 3 months after enrollment of pregnant women, prior        to or as close to birth as possible. Compounds shared a latrine, so sanitation and handwashing interventions were delivered a the compound-level. Nutritional        interventions were delivered directly to the child participant within households.          Water quality: The study installed chlorine dispensers within the cluster boundary at public water sources used by study participants.          All community members were also able to use the dispensers. After filling their water collection container (typically a 20 L plastic jerry can) at the          source, users could place the container under the dispenser and turn a knob to release 3 mL of 1.25% sodium hypochlorite, an amount designed to yield          2 mL/L of free chlorine residual after 30 min for 20 L of water. The study also included community level promotion of dispenser use and all households          in the study compound received bottles of sodium hypochlorite (6 months' supply) to facilitate householders' water treatment during periods when they          rely on rainwater harvesting (common during the rainy season) or if they use a water source in which a dispenser has not been installed. Households were          visited monthly by community-based health promoters.  Sanitation: The sanitation intervention included three hardware components: (1) All existing latrines in the compound were          upgraded by installing a plastic slab with a tight-fitting lid. Households without latrines or with poor qualiity latrines were provided with         a new dual pit latrine. (2) Sani-scoop hoes dedicated to the removal of human and animal feces from the compound were provided to all households          in the compound. (3) Plastic child potties were provided to all households in the compound that had any children younger than 3 years. The behavior change components of         the intervention emphasized the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of feces in the compound courtyard to prevent         contact with young children. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Handwashing: The hardware components of the handwashing intervention included two handwashing stations installed in all households.          The first station was located in the kitchen (location of food preparation) and the other located near the toilet. Handwashing stations were constructed from locally available materials and included         a dual tippy-tap design with independent pedals attached to two 5 L jerry cans of clean water and soapy water. The study provided detergent soap to families          free of charge to replenish the soapy water bottles. The behavior change component of the intervention focused messaging for handwashing at two critical times:          after defecation and before food preparation. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing (WSH): Households received all three of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          and handwashing study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Nutrition: Mothers were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children through age 6 months. When newborns reached         6 months of age, mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding their children until 24 months, and received education about         supplementing breastfeeding with healthy complementary foods following infant and young child feeding best practice guidelines from         Unicef and         WHO.         From ages 6 - 24 months, study children received a daily lipid-based nutritional supplement (LNS) that has been developed and tested         through the iLiNS project. The study also provided LNS to older, age-eligible siblings (6-24 months)          living in study households to prevent potential sharing of LNS with older siblings. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing + Nutrition (WSHN): Households received all four of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          handwashing, and nutrition study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Double-sized active control arm: Households did not receive any intervention, but were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Passive control arm: Households did not receive any intervention and were not visited by community-based health promotors.   Units of Data Collection: Clusters consisted of 1 or more administrative villages; two or more neighboring may have been combined to create 1 cluster as        long as the cluster of villages had at least 8 eligible pregnant women and shared a border. Households were the family unit of parents and children, and compounds        were groups of households (typically 1-4 households from the same extended family). When multiple pregnant women from a single compound were eligible for        enrollment, more than one household may have been enrolled for that compound. Data about each compound were collected from households belonging to        that compound, and responses from various households about that compound's characteristics may differ.        Children who were born to the pregnant women initially enrolled in the study were        considered "target" children. Children aged <36 months living in the compound at enrollment and additional children born into study compounds after 6 months were        considered "sibling/neighbor" children.         Data Collection: A survey at enrollment (year 0, pre-intervention baseline) measured household socioeconomic characteristics and demographics (including maternal        age, maternal education, electricity access, type of floor, and number of people in the household), as well as water, sanitation, and handwashing infrastructure and behaviors        (including type of water source, reported water treatment, defecation location, type of toilet, and presence of water and soap at a handwashing station). Adherence to the        interventions was measured by surveying each enrolled household during unannounced visits 1 year post-intervention (midline) and 2 years post-intervention (endline).        Caregiver reported symptoms were assessed at enrollment, midline, and endline; anthropometry was assessed 1 at midline and endline.

Last Updated: March 8, 2021WASH Benefits Kenya was a cluster-randomized trial that assessed improvements in water quality, sanitation, handwashing (WASH interventions) and child nutrition on the primary outcomes of child growth and diarrhea. Geographically matched clusters (groups of household compounds) were randomized to one of six intervention arms (1. water quality, 2. sanitation, 3. handwashing, 4. nutrition, 5. combined water quality + sanitation + handwashing, and 6. combined water quality + sanitation + handwashing + nutrition) or two control arms (1. active, and 2. passive). Newborns from rural households in Kenya were enrolled and outcomes were measured at 12 and 24 months after intervention delivery.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Cluster-randomized controlled trial - Surveys - Anthropometry assessments - Data integration - Data cleaning - Codebook creation - Adherence assessment - Behavioral messaging - Nutritional supplementation - Intervention delivery
clinepidb_DS_515a92c711	ClinEpiDB	LAKANA Cluster Randomized Trial	Background: Mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin has been shown        to reduce under-5 mortality in some but not all sub-Saharan African settings. Because of this observed heterogeneity and possible effect modification by SMC or other co-interventions, further trials were needed in order to determine the efficacy in additional settings and to determine the most effective treatment regimen.        Objectives:   Evaluate the impact of two azithromycin MDA regimens on infant mortality and other health outcomes, when provided in a rural West-African high-mortality context with an ongoing seasonal malaria chemoprevention program. Evaluate the effect of alternative MDA frequencies on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and host microbiota composition. Investigate the feasibility, acceptability and equity of alternative MDA strategies. Test hypotheses that azithromycin MDA eliminates malaria parasitaemia and reduces systemic and intestinal inflammation in asymptomatic children and to collect and store biological samples for assessing other possible mechanisms of azithromycin effect.    Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The LAKANA trial will be implemented in approximately 830 villages from 7-10 health districts in the Kayes, Kita and Koulikoro regions of Mali.        Dates of Data Collection: July 2020-July 2023 (anticipated)        Study Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial        Study Arms: LAKANA is a cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, three-arm clinical trial, with adaptive design. Participating villages will be randomly allocated to three different intervention groups in a ratio of 3 : 2 : 4 (control : azithromycin quarterly : azithromycin biannually).        Data Collection: Within each village, consenting households will be visited quarterly (at 3-month intervals), nine times. At the first eight of these visits, 1-11-month-old eligible infants (age 29-364 days), for whom there is a consent for study drug provision, will be weighed and given a single dose of study drug (azithromycin mixture or respective placebo mixture). Household data collected will include a household composition survey, household assets survey, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) questionnaire. Individual level data include morbidity and mortality data, treatment information, and serious adverse events. In addition, biological samples will be collected from a sub-sample of participants to support mechanistic and AMR sub-studies.         Study Documentation:  Study protocol:  LAKANA protocol version 2.0, 2019-12-17   Case report forms: These will be made available once finalized        Standard operating procedures: SOPs and other supporting documentation will be made available for review once finalized          ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files will be provided to ClinEpiDB as Stata files. These datasets will be converted to txt files and merged by unique ID and redundant or administrative columns will be dropped from presentation on ClinEpiDB.org. All dates will be obfuscated per participant through the application of a random number algorithm that shifts dates no more than seven days to comply with the ethical conduct of human subjects' research.

clinepidb_DS_4d72506014	ClinEpiDB	Asia Pacific ICEMR Cambodian Cross-sectional	Background: In Cambodia, significant achievements have been made over the past decade in reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality. However, transmission is endemic in 21 of 25 provinces and it is estimated that 58% of the population, or approximately 8.6 million people, continue to live in malaria at-risk areas. The incidence of clinical cases is highest in the north-eastern part of the country, with the highest risk in forest or forest fringe areas of the country, usually found along the borders. It is therefore very important to i) characterize region specific demographic and geographic determinants of (especially asymptomatic) malaria infection ii) determine the relationship between different measures of malaria infection and exposure and iii) implement malaria surveillance and control strategies using this knowledge to optimise the distribution of limited resources to detect as many infections as possible.        Objectives:   To determine age-specific prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infections by qPCR and light microscopy  To investigate individual and spatial risk factors for Plasmodium spp. infections  To determine the genetic complexity of Plasmodium spp. infections within and between populations To determine the prevalence of antibodies to panels P. falciparum and P. vivax antigens To determine the prevalence of molecular markers of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax parasites. Determine the prevalence and type of G6PD deficiency and CYP 2D6 polymorphisms  Methodology: Household-based cross-sectional prevalence survey with collection of epidemiological data associated with risk of malaria and biological samples to determine current infection status.

clinepidb_DS_4d0fe88b6b	ClinEpiDB	SCORE Niger S. haematobium Cluster Randomized Trial	Related studies:   SCORE Mozambique S. haematobium Cluster Randomized Trial SCORE S. mansoni Cluster Randomized Trial    Background:  Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. It is estimated that 3.2 million people are infected with schistosomiasis in Niger. Mass drug administration (MDA) with the drug praziquantel is the mainstay of schistosomiasis control.              Existing thresholds for implementation of mass treatment for schistosomiasis needed refinement and a better evidence base to establish the relative benefits of different age-group coverage formats and different schedules of targeted mass praziquantel delivery. There was interest in finding out whether, when compared with school-based treatment, using one or more years of community-wide treatment would have a greater impact on the prevalence and intensity of infection if, for example, community-wide treatment could achieve better coverage of school-aged children who did not attend school or better coverage of high-risk adults. There also was a lack of data as to whether every-other-year delivery of MDA could be sufficient for morbidity control.         Objectives: The primary research question addressed in this study is which MDA strategy- annual versus biannual school-based treatment or community-wide treatment - provided the greatest reduction in prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection among 9-12 year-olds after four years of intervention. In addition, the impact of treatment on first-year students and adults was also assessed.        Methodology  Study Sites: The study was conducted in 225 villages in nine districts in Western Niger along the Niger River Valley- the region of Tillabery (Kollo, Say, Tera, Filingué and Tillabery districts), Dosso (Loga district) and Niamey (districts 1-3).        Dates of Data Collection: 2011- 2015        Study Design: Cluster-randomized trial        Data Collection  Sampling: A total of 225 villages were enrolled in the study, with 100 children aged 9-12 years tested each year per village. In addition, systematic random sampling was used in each village to select a further 100 first-year students (aged 5-8 years) in all 225 villages at the first and fifth years only. A convenience sample of 50 adults (aged 22-50 years) were sampled in the first and last year of villages with a starting S. haematobium prevalence over 25%.       Village-level data: Data was collected from each study village on geographic location (latitude, longitude) and data related to MDA coverage- total village population, population treated by MDA, number of school-aged children, number of school-aged children treated by MDA. Individual-level data: Demographic data on age and sex was collected from each participant. A single urine sample was collected from each individual in the study for assessment of the S. haematobium egg burden by urine filtration and microscopy.         ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as cleaned .csv files with all personal identifiers removed. All dates were obfuscated per individual through the application of a random number algorithm that shifted dates no more than seven days to comply with the ethical conduct of human subjects research.        Acknowledgements: We are grateful to the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative for providing praziquantel for the study, through the donation to the Ministry of Health in Niger. We thank the technicians for their support in the field and the laboratory. We are grateful to the health, education, and village authorities of all districts for their contribution. Finally, we thank all the children, parents, teachers, and village leaders who participated in this study.        Financial Support: SCORE is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through a grant to the University of Georgia Research Foundation (UGARF).        Ethics Statement: The study protocol has been approved by the National Ethics Committee in Niger (ref 012/2010/CCNE) and Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (ref ICREC_8_2_2). In addition to these, the University of Georgia institutional review board IRB implemented an administrative human subjects review and issued additional approval 10533-0 for Niger. Informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of all pupils involved in the study and verbal consent was also obtained from all adults included. The purpose of the study was explained to education and health authorities. All results in the datasets were anonymous and coded to prevent association with the individual participant.        Last Updated: March 8, 2021To provide an evidence base for cost-effective schistosomiasis control, a five-year study cluster-randomised trial in Niger investigated six possible combinations of annual or biannual community-wide treatment, school-based treatment, and holidays from mass treatment over four years. The primary outcome of interest was prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma haematobium among 100 children aged 9-12 years sampled each year in each village. The relative reduction of prevalence was greater in biannual compared with annual treatment across all arms; however, the only significant difference was seen in areas with a high starting prevalence.	gpt-3.5-turbo	Cluster-randomized trial, mass drug administration (MDA), urine filtration, microscopy, systematic random sampling, convenience sampling
clinepidb_DS_4902d9b7ec	ClinEpiDB	India ICEMR Fever Surveillance	Related Studies:   India ICEMR Cohort India ICEMR Cross-sectional India ICEMR Severe P. vivax and falciparum Cohort India ICEMR Behavior Cross-sectional India ICEMR Meghalaya Cross-sectional India ICEMR DAMaN Quasi-experimental Stepped-wedge    Background: Fever is frequently reported by patients using general medicine outpatient departments in Indian hospitals. However, even when additional clinical symptoms are collected for diagnosis and treatment, those symptoms are often nonspecific. Delays or inaccuracies in arriving at a clinical diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment that may result in fatalities. To establish a specific diagnosis and provide the appropriate treatment regimen, diagnoses of febrile illnesses should be confirmed by laboratory tests.        Objectives: This study describes a pilot project to determine whether chikungunya, dengue, and scrub typhus were common among patients presenting with acute febrile illness who had been triaged for malaria in an outpatient department (OPD) at Ispat General Hospital, Rourkela, in the state of Odisha, India. A second aim of the study was to undertake a comparative assessment of the performance of several standard, commercially available diagnostic tests for these three febrile illnesses. A third aim was to determine if malaria cases were missed during the initial malaria triage by the OPD.        Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Ispat General Hospital in Rourkela, Sundargarh District, in the state of Odisha, India          Dates of Data Collection: January 2016-January 2017          Study Design: Health center surveillance study          Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following criteria           Inclusion criteria:  Aged 12 months to 70 years (children categorized as ≤15 years and adults as ≥16 years) Report of fever up to 48 hours prior to enrollment or febrile on the day of enrollment (body temperature ≥37.5°C)   Exclusion criteria:  Probable malaria cases identified based on presence of high fever, chills, and rigor during triage in the OPD Individuals with symptoms of influenza Pregnant women    Data Collection: 954 OPD patients were enrolled who had already been through triage for malaria in the OPD, where probable malaria cases were identified based on presence of high fever, chills, and rigor. Written consent or assent was obtained from each enrolled patient prior to a physical examination and administration of a detailed clinical questionnaire, and each patient provided a blood sample. All 954 enrollees were tested for malaria by at least one diagnostic test; a subset of enrollees (293/954) from whom a larger volume of blood was collected was also tested for dengue, chikungunya, and scrub typhus by either RDT, ELISA, or both tests.

clinepidb_DS_477ce63d68	ClinEpiDB	SIP Cohort	Background: Infants born preterm may develop conditions that place them at higher risk for short-term health problems, long-term neurological complications, and even death. In high-income countries, most infants born preterm survive, but in the poorest regions of the world, babies born preterm are at very high risk of death; in the first month of life up to half may die. Few studies to date have examined the specific conditions that lead to death among preterm babies in low-income countries. Data collected in this study can be used to help plan interventions to reduce deaths among preterm infants.        Objectives: The primary objective of the study was to determine the most common causes of illness and mortality in preterm infants admitted to hospitals in Ethiopia. Secondary objectives included:          To determine the proportion of positive blood and cerebral spinal fluid cultures among preterm infants with a final diagnosis of sepsis To determine the proportion of radiological findings consistent with RDS To determine the proportion of head ultrasound findings consistent with intraventricular haemorrhage To determine maternal/obstetric risk factors that are associated with preterm birth and mortality in preterm infants To classify preterm infants based on gestational age (GA) and birth weight (if known) as extremely preterm (< 28 weeks) very preterm (28-32 weeks) preterm (32-37 weeks) in relation to the cause of death, to understand the GA where most of the deaths are concentrated and the corresponding birth weight if known To compare the clinical final diagnosis of preterm infants that die with the results from the diagnosis obtained by standard autopsy and Minimally Invasive Tissue Sampling (MITS)   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: 5 hospitals in 3 different regions of Ethiopia - Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Ghandi Memorial Hospital, and St Paul Hospital in Addis Ababa; Gondar University Hospital in northern Ethiopia; and Jimma University Hospital in southwest Ethiopia        Dates of Data Collection: July 2016 to June 2018        Study Design: Longitudinal cohort of preterm infants        Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following         Inclusion criteria:  Mother delivered at or baby transferred to one of the participating study hospitals Gestational age is <37 weeks as estimated with an algorithm using ultrasound, last menstrual period, or new Ballard Score Live born defined as cry, breathing or movement after delivery or Apgar ≥ 1 Infant age is < 7 days when screened Consent given for study participation  Exclusion criteria  Delivery is a result of an induced abortion Gestational age cannot be reliably determined using study criteria    Data Collection: Participants were enrolled either when 1) a woman who had been seen for antenatal care in the study hospital went into preterm labor, and the infant was born alive at the study hospital or home, 2) a woman who came in preterm labor to the study hospital (either from home or referred from another health facility) delivered a live infant, or 3) a woman who delivered a preterm infant at home or in another hospital brought her infant to the NICU at < 7 days of life. Socio-demographic, obstetric, and maternal factors were collected at enrollment. Healthy infants underwent a physical examination and were discharged home. Infants admitted to the NICU were evaluated at least twice daily by a nurse while in the NICU, and clinical information and laboratory test results were documented. Upon discharge from the NICU, final diagnoses were recorded. Infants discharged alive were followed weekly by phone and face to face meetings (at least once) until the age of 28 days. Vital status was collected at each observation, and anthropometric measurements were collected at face to face visits. For infants who died, parents were asked whether they would consent to a post-mortem examination, either a whole body diagnostic autopsy or minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS). The relevant clinical, laboratory, and autopsy data was made available for a panel of experts to evaluate cause of death.

This study aimed to assess the individual and village-level patterns of Plasmodium infection in two districts of the northeastern state of Meghalaya and evaluate risk and geospatial factors that might explain these patterns.        Objectives:   Determine the individual and village-level prevalence of Plasmodium infections (symptomatic, asymptomatic, and subpatent) in two districts of Meghalaya, India via RDT and PCR Identify risk factors for Plasmodium infection, including sociodemographic, environmental, behavioral, and geospatial factors    Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: West Jaintia Hills and West Khasi Hills districts, Meghalaya, India            Dates of Data Collection: April-November 2018; follow-up May-September 2019            Study Design: Community-based survey with resampling the following year            Eligibility Criteria: Barato PHC (primary health center) in West Jaintia Hills and Nonglang PHC in West Khasi Hills were chosen for sampling based on annual parasite incidence (API) relative to other PHCs within the districts. The villages within each PHC catchment area were selected for surveying based on API, logistics, and representation across both the PHCs and their regional sub-centers. To achieve the study sample size, 50% of households in each village were selected using the Probability Proportion to Size (PPS) technique at random from the sampling frame provided by the ASHA in each village. Additional households were sampled on as needed basis to fulfill target enrollment numbers. All eligible consenting individuals from each selected household were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were defined as individuals between the ages of 1 and 69 years with no immediate health risks and apparent full comprehension of the study procedures.            Data Collection: Data were collected electronically using the REDCap Mobile Application on Samsung tablets. Answers to the household survey were given by one resident, most commonly the 'head of household,' followed by individual surveys administered in the local language to each individual resident of the household, consisting of a pre-tested, structured interview with mostly close-ended questions. Demographic information (age, gender, education, occupation), medical history (fever, episodes of malaria, antimalarial use in the past year, other complaints), travel history over the past two weeks, and data on use of malaria prevention methods (e.g., insecticide treated nets (ITNs), repellents, coils) were also obtained. Daily behaviors and practices were also surveyed, with a focus on those that may put individuals at risk of infection, such as participation in outdoor activities during the evening. Parents or caretakers responded to some questions on behalf of their child(ren) for questions where the child did not have the knowledge or understanding to provide an answer. All households with enrolled study participants were also spatially mapped via Global Positioning System (GPS).

clinepidb_DS_450c62c7d0	ClinEpiDB	Jilinde Costing Study of PrEP in Kenya	Related studies:  JILINDE Prospective Cohort Study   Background:        In recent years, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been positioned squarely on the prevention agenda of many countries with a high burden of HIV. In 2016, the Kenya Ministry of Health, following the guidance of the WHO, revised the national "Guidelines on Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treatment and Prevention of HIV Infection " (NASCOP, 2016), and recommended the provision of PrEP to all individuals at substantial ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection. Subsequently, the government launched a national PrEP scale-up program in May 2017.               However, as the government of Kenya continues to scale up PrEP, there is limited knowledge on the cost of scaling up the use of oral PrEP among Key and Vulnerable Populations (KVPs). The Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project commenced in July 2016 with an overall objective of supporting the government of Kenya to scale-up oral PrEP across the country. Jilinde conducted this study to assess the cost of PrEP for various KVPs using various models of service delivery and geographic regions of Kenya.              In this study we estimated the cost of PrEP from two different perspectives: the service delivery perspective and the client perspective. The service delivery perspective involved collecting cost data from health facility managers and by type of service delivery model (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, public health facilities that have integrated PrEP into the existing services and private clinics or social franchise clinics). This was to enable an analysis of the average unit cost of PrEP, as well as an analysis of the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya 's existing prevention strategy among KVPs. The output of the activity is an estimate of cost per person year (PPY) of service delivery. The second perspective involved measuring costs borne by the clients (financial and opportunity costs). By understanding what costs are incurred by the clients, it is then possible to better understand if these costs represent a significant barrier to PrEP uptake.               In addition, the costing study also examined the client willingness to pay for oral PrEP services (medications, laboratory procedures, etc.). This contingent valuation analysis was critical in not only understanding how much clients are willing to pay, but also to better understand the factors that cause clients to have greater or lesser motivation to seek out these services.         Objectives: The aim of the study was to estimate the full cost and unit cost of the PrEP scale-up program for different KVPs in Kenya.          Specific objectives:     To determine the current unit costs of providing PrEP by mode of service delivery (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, private sector and social franchise clinics and public health facilities) for various KVPs and geographic regions of Kenya; To estimate direct costs incurred by clients (financial and opportunity costs) in accessing PrEP;  To analyze the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya's existing prevention strategy among KVPs;  To determine willingness to pay for PrEP services.   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Data was collected from ten counties in Kenya where the Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project was implemented. The counties were clustered based on geographical proximity; Nairobi cluster (Nairobi, Kiambu, and Machakos); Coast cluster (Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, and Taita Taveta); Lake cluster (Kisumu, Kisii and Migori counties).  Dates of Data Collection: Data were collected from October 2017 to August 2018.        Study Design: This was a cross-sectional study that collected both quantitative and qualitative data through surveys with PrEP clients and key informant interviews with health facility managers.  Eligibility Criteria:           For the health facility costing, the study population included all public and private health facilities and community drop in centres in the three regions (Coast cluster, Lake Cluster and Nairobi Cluster) which had integrated PrEP services. Respondents were the health facility managers.            For the client costing survey, the study population included female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM) and adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) who had initiated PrEP through the different facilities supported by the Jilinde project. For the willingness to pay survey, the study population included clients (FSW, MSM and AGYW) who had initiated PrEP and those who had been offered PrEP services but had declined.        Data Collection:           Costing and utilisation data were collected from a sample of 44 facilities consisting of 23 public health facilities (County Referral Hospital, Sub-County Hospital, Health Centres and Dispensaries), 5 private facilities/clinics and 16 drop-in centres (DICEs). Six research assistants (two for each cluster), and the study investigators were responsible for data collection in all the sampled facilities.            For the facility costing, the study team conducted a semi-structured in-depth interview with facility managers to obtain information on the costs of resources used in delivering PrEP services. Data on all resources used in delivering PrEP services (personnel, equipment, medications, consumables, lab tests and reagents, test kits, utility, maintenance, and utilities) was collected for each visit (initial visit or first contact, refill visits and revisits) and for each stage of client flow in a facility: i) Reception, ii) Triage, iii) Health education, iv) HTS and STI testing, v) Prescription of drugs and vi) Dispensing drugs client). This service delivery process was useful in assisting the research team obtain relevant data for PrEP costing at each stage.             The client costing and willingness to pay data were collected through a structured, exit interview questionnaire, which was administered by the six Research Assistants at each of the 44 service delivery sites. PrEP clients were informed about the study by service providers, and those who expressed interest were referred to the research team within the facility, who screened for eligibility and administered consent. The research assistants documented whether it was an initial or follow-up refill or monitoring visit.           The client costing questionnaire was designed to gather, among others, demographic and socio-economic data, direct cost of accessing PrEP services (out-of-pocket expenses), and indirect cost in the form of productivity loss by the client (opportunity cost) when seeking services. The willingness to pay (WTP) questionnaire documented the participants personal and household characteristics (age, religion, marital status, individual income, household income, level of education, employment status, etc.), their willingness to pay for PrEP services, and reasons informing their decisions. Respondents who indicated a willingness to pay were shown 14 random payment cards, with various amounts, which varied from Kshs 0 to Kshs 10,000 (US$100) and asked to indicate which card represented the highest amount they would be willing to pay on a monthly basis for PrEP services.  Once an amount was selected, they were then shown the card with the next highest amount and asked if they would pay that amount.  If the respondent indicated "no", then the original amount selected would be identified as the maximum WTP.  If the respondent indicated "yes", then the next highest card was selected, and they were again asked if they would be willing to pay this amount.  In this way, the respondent is "bid up" until they confirm that the amount indicated is truly the maximum WTP.  After two attempts to "bid up" the respondent, the bidding process ended, and the highest amount was confirmed.

clinepidb_DS_2a6ace17a1	ClinEpiDB	GEMS1A Case Control	Related studies:   GEMS1A HUAS Lite Survey: Two community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Surveys conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1A case control study. GEMS1 Case Control is the case control study preceding this follow-on study. GEMS1 HUAS/HUAS Lite Survey: Three community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Surveys conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1 case control study.    Background: The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) was a prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study of the burden, etiology, and adverse clinical outcomes of diarrheal diseases among children aged 0-59 months seeking care at health care facilities during a 36-month period at seven sites in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. GEMS1 aimed to elucidate the more clinically severe medically-attended diarrheal episodes to guide and prioritize efforts to prevent the most life-threatening and disabling illnesses. It is also important to characterize the "less severe" diarrhea (LSD) episodes for which care is sought at health care facilities, recognizing that even though there may be fewer adverse health consequences from these illnesses, the overall LSD burden could be greater because it is more common than "moderate-to-severe" diarrhea (MSD). Whether there are meaningful differences in the distribution of etiologies of LSD compared with MSD also must be understood to optimize diarrheal disease prevention and treatment. Therefore a one-year follow-on study designated GEMS-1A was conducted in which six GEMS sites performed simultaneous case-control studies of both MSD and LSD, and one GEMS site performed a case-control study of MSD only. At the time of these studies, no site had introduced rotavirus vaccine into its Expanded Program on Immunization for young infants.        Objectives: The objective of GEMS-1A was to determine whether the findings of GEMS were generalizable to episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD), which represent the majority of paediatric diarrhea in patients presenting to health-care centres. This study was designed to simultaneously examine MSD and LSD.                The primary outcomes of the GEMS-1A study were to characterize, for LSD in addition to MSD, the overall and pathogen-specific population-based attributable incidence and the pathogen-specific attributable fraction, and to assess the frequency of nutritional faltering and other adverse clinical consequences among children with these two diarrheal syndromes relative to the control population. The outcomes were assessed by site and age stratum, and across all sites for incidence and nutritional outcomes.        Methodology:  Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS-1A- four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).          Dates of Data Collection: October 2011- January 2013        Study Design: Case-Control study        Eligibility Criteria: Participants at each site belonged to a censused population serially updated for births, deaths, and migrations using a demographic surveillance system (DSS). For case enrollment, sites selected sentinel hospitals or health centers (SHCs) where DSS children sought care for diarrheal illnesses.         Cases: All children aged 0-59 months belonging to the DSS population at each site who sought care at a SHC during a 12-month period were screened for diarrhea (>3 loose stools during the previous 24 hours). Episodes eligible for inclusion as MSD were new (onset after >7 diarrhea-free days), acute (onset within the previous 7 days), and satisfied at least one of the following criteria for MSD:         Sunken eyes (confirmed by parent/caretaker as more than normal)  Loss of skin turgor (abdominal skin pinch with slow [even a brief instant] or very slow [>2 seconds] recoil)  Intravenous hydration administered or prescribed  Dysentery (visible blood in loose stools)  Hospitalized         The remaining new and acute diarrhea episodes were considered LSD. Note, in Kenya, almost no LSD cases presented to health centers, so LSD cases were not recruited.        Controls: For each case of MSD or LSD enrolled, we enrolled 1-3 community control children without diarrhea in the last 7 days, randomly selected from the site's DSS database within 14 days of the case. Controls were matched to each individual case by age, gender, and residence (same or nearby village or neighborhood as the case).         Data Collection: At enrollment, parents/primary caretakers of cases and controls underwent standardized interviews to solicit demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical information. GEMS staff measured the child's length/height. Medical management by clinicians at the SHC and clinical condition upon discharge were documented. A single follow-up home visit was performed ~60 days after enrollment to assess the child's vital status and repeat anthropometric measurements. At enrollment, each case and control provided fresh stool that was placed in cold storage and transport media according to the protocol. If antibiotics were to be administered to cases before stool was produced, two rectal swabs were obtained for bacterial culture pending passage of the whole stool for the remaining assays. With few exceptions, GEMS-1A utilized the same clinical/epidemiologic, microbiologic, data management, and analytic methods described for the GEMS1 36-month study of MSD alone.

clinepidb_DS_22e3c3c070	ClinEpiDB	Kalifabougou Malaria Cohort	Background: Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a global public health threat, while leading vaccine candidates confer only partial short-lived protection at best. An understanding of the mechanisms by which humans acquire malaria immunity through repeated P. falciparum infections may aid the development of a malaria vaccine. Since May 2011 this observational cohort study has been conducted in Kalifabougou, Mali as a close collaboration between the Malaria Research and Training Center at the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health. Kalifabougou is a rural village of approximately 5000 inhabitants located 48 km northwest of Bamako in a region of Mali that typically experiences intense, seasonal P. falciparum transmission from July through December.        Objectives: Better understand fundamental aspects of malaria epidemiology, the human immune response to malaria, and the biology of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the context of intense seasonal malaria transmission.        Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Kalifabougou, Mali        Dates of Data Collection: May 2011 to present (ongoing)        Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study        Eligibility Criteria: From an age-stratified, random sample of the entire village population, 695 healthy individuals aged 3 months-25 years were initially enrolled, with periodic enrollment of new healthy volunteers subsequently. The disproportionate sample size of each age group reflects the design of this ongoing study of malaria immunity, which focuses on older children as they transition from malaria susceptibility to immunity. Enrollment exclusion criteria are hemoglobin level <7 g/dL, axillary temperature ≥37.5°C, acute systemic illness, use of antimalarial or immunosuppressive medications in the past 30 days, and pregnancy.         Data Collection: Clinical malaria episodes are detected prospectively by self-referral and by weekly or monthly active clinical surveillance visits depending on the study year. All individuals with signs and symptoms of malaria and any level of Plasmodium parasitemia detected by light microscopy are treated according to the National Malaria Control Program guidelines in Mali. In general, the research definition of malaria is an axillary temperature of ≥37.5°C, ≥2500 asexual parasites/µL of blood, and no other cause of fever discernible by physical exam. During the scheduled clinic visits that occur before, during and after each malaria season, and at the first research-defined malaria episode of each malaria season, blood is collected by finger prick to prepare blood smears and dried blood spots on filter paper, and venous blood is collected to isolate and cryopresrve peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma.         Study Documentation:   Case report forms (zip file) Data dictionaries (zip file)    ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as flat txt files. These datasets were merged by unique ID and redundant or administrative columns were dropped from presentation on ClinEpiDB.org.

Written, informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians of participating children or from adult participants.        Last Updated: December 23, 2021A longitudinal cohort study of malaria was conducted in Kalifabougou, Mali. Healthy individuals 3-25 years were initally enrolled, with subsequent periodic enrollment of additional healthy volunteers. Participants had monthly or weekly scheduled visits and would come to the clinic for unscheduled visits when sick.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Longitudinal cohort study - Data collection - Blood smear preparation - Dried blood spot collection - Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolation - Plasma isolation - Data integration - Data merging - Obfuscation of dates - Financial support - Ethics approval - Informed consent
clinepidb_DS_221d2bcac4	ClinEpiDB	GEMS1 HUAS/HUAS Lite Survey	Related studies:   GEMS1 Case Control GEMS1A Case Control GEMS1A HUAS Lite Survey    Background: The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) 1 HUAS/HUAS Lite surveys were two community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Surveys (HUAS) conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1 Case Control study. These surveys provide data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment.              Ideally 100% of patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhea would have received care at the hospital(s) or urgent care setting(s) participating in the study at the field site where cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea were counted and analyzed, designated henceforth as the "sentinel health centers". Because the catchment population at most of the sites was quite large and there are typically multiple sources of health care, it may be logistically impractical to maintain both surveillance for moderate-to-severe diarrhea and the ability to enroll patients into the case-control study at all the health care facilities that serve the population. Moreover, at each site some fraction of children would not reach a health care facility when they have moderate-to-severe diarrhea. If the HUAS indicates that the point estimate of patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhea treated at the sentinel health centers falls below 75%, measures were taken to try and increase this percentage by including additional health care facilities in the surveillance.        Objectives: Data from the GEMS1 1 HUAS/HUAS Lite surveys was used in different ways-        To optimize the surveillance for determining disease burden To perform data adjustments to account for the proportion of children with diarrhea who do not seek care at the health care facilities participating in GEMS surveillance To calculate population-based incidence rates To compare data between the different sites To assess public perception of the need for interventions to prevent childhood diarrhea   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS1, four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).          Dates of Data Collection: March 2007- December 2010; the HUAS survey was conducted at the beginning of the study and HUAS Lite was conducted twice a year over the course of the study.        Study Design: Community-based Cross-sectional Survey        Eligibility Criteria: From the census at each study site, updated by ongoing demographic surveillance, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). The census databases were as current as possible, in order to include recent births and to put children who have crossed an age group boundary in the appropriate group. The list defines the population from which the HUAS sample is drawn. Even with the updated list, there may be births between the time of preparation of the list and conduct of the survey, so that infants at the earliest ages may be somewhat underrepresented in the HUAS.              Each of the sites selected a random selection of approximately 400 eligible from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group, e.g., because of aging and higher mortality rates), and 370 eligible children from each of the two older age strata (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.        Data Collection: The interviewer went to the child's home and described the study to the selected child's parent or primary caretaker. If the parent or primary caretaker wished to participate, the consent form was read aloud by the interviewer in the local language and the parent/primary caretaker was given an opportunity to ask questions. Thereafter, s/he would either provide a signature or (if s/he did not know how to write) place a mark on the consent form (this could be an "x" or a fingerprint) in the presence of a witness (who would also sign the form) indicating his/her willingness to participate. The parent or primary caretaker received a copy of the signed consent form to keep and the original was stored in the regulatory files at the study site. The respondent was the child's primary caretaker. If a primary caretaker was not available, this was recorded and the interviewer tried to leave a message indicating when the interviewer would be likely to return. A total of 3 attempts were made to contact a primary caretaker after which time the child was considered a nonresponder.              The data collected from the ~60 questions asked include information about the household and family composition, occurrence of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. HUAS Lite contained a subset of questions from the longer HUAS survey. The HUAS questionnaire also provided an opportunity to query a representative sample of the population on their attitudes concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment. The survey may have been modified as appropriate for each site, while adhering to the main elements. In some countries, birth dates may not be known and it may be necessary to use an events calendar to estimate ages.              The questionnaires allowed the estimation of the ability of the sentinel health centers at each study site to capture at least 75% of the cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea within the 7-day eligibility period. The survey also made it possible to determine the true incidence of moderate-to-severe diarrhea at the end of the study period. If the child did not experience moderate-to-severe diarrhea during the past 14 days, then parents were asked hypothetical questions about their anticipated health care utilization should their child develop such an illness. This permitted a determination of the proportion of mothers who would use the sentinel health centers if their children had an episode of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in the future.Information on the respondents' perceptions about the danger of diarrheal diseases in children, their attitudes about the importance of developing vaccines and other interventions were also collected.        Study documentation:    HUAS Questionnaire HUAS Lite Questionnaire   Last Updated: May 6, 2021       The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) 1 HUAS/HUAS Lite surveys were three community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Surveys (HUAS, HUAS lite, and HUAS lite - Kenya) conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1 case control study. These cross-sectional surveys provide data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention, and treatment.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Cross-sectional survey - Data adjustment - Data collection - Geographic location mapping - Random sampling - Demographic surveillance - Attitudinal survey analysis - Incidence rate calculation - Population comparison analysis

Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. Children and males were found to be at higher risk of malaria than older people and females. In 2017, we undertook a subsequent behavioral survey among 500 participants in 237 households of four of the medium and high malaria villages.         Objectives: Investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk.        Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Odisha, India        Dates of Data Collection: February-May 2017        Study Design: Cross-sectional survey        Eligibility Criteria: Participants must have been aged 12 months to 69 years. Pregnant women were excluded.        Data Collection: In a published survey around Rourkela in 2013-2014 (N=1307), malaria  prevalence was found to be 8.3%. Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. Our analyses showed that the rainy season and male gender were risk factors for malaria; in high malaria villages, young age was an additional risk factor, and indoor and outdoor spraying was protective compared to no spraying. We undertook a subsequent behavioral survey in four of the medium and high malaria villages in 2017 to investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk among 500 participants in 237 households. Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with sections on malaria history and use of mosquito protection; blood was collected for microscopy, a rapid malaria test, and PCR testing.

clinepidb_DS_0086998c2f	ClinEpiDB	SHINE Cluster Randomized Trial	Related studies:   WASH Benefits Bangladesh WASH Benefits Kenya    Background: Childhood stunting and anemia are a perverse public health problem in developing countries. Globally, stunting affects 26% of children under the age of five and underlies 15-17% of their mortality. Stunting has been shown to lead to long-term cognitive deficits, few years and poorer performance in school, lower economic productivity as adults and a higher risk of stunting in their own children.        Objectives: The SHINE trial was motivated by a two part premise.         Environmental enteric dysfunction (EDD) is a major cause of child stunting and anemia     Primary cause of EED is infant ingestion of fecal microbes due to living condition of poor quality and quantity of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)    Primary study objective:    Determine the independent and combined effects of improved household WASH and improved IYCF on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV negative women in rural Zimbabwe.    Secondary study objectives:   Examine the effects of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on stunting (LAZ less than -2) anemia (hemoglobin less than 105 g/L) among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV-negative women in rural Zimbabwe. Examine differential effects on length and hemoglobin concentration at 18 mo of the 2 randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) in these prespecified subgroups: children born to HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative mothers; male and female children; Subgroups formed by categorizing household wealth, household distance from a water point, and maternal capabilities. Examine the independent and combined effects of the 2 randomized interventions on body weight, mid-upper arm circumference and head circumference at 18 mo, and on all anthropometric measures at intermediate ages (1, 3, 6, and 12 mo). Describe the PIP linking implementation of each randomized intervention (WASH and IYCF) with length and hemoglobin concentrations. Assess potential effect modifiers along the PIP Describe the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among all infants enrolled in the trial by maternal/infant HIV status.  Evaluate the effect of the IYCF intervention on uptake of improved infant feeding practices by maternal/infant HIV status.  Evaluate the effect of the WASH intervention on the five key behaviors it promotes by maternal/infant HIV status: proper disposal of animal and human feces; handwashing with soap after fecal contact; point-of-use chlorination of drinking water; protecting children from ingestion of dirt and feces; feeding baby freshly prepared foods, or reheating leftover food. Elucidate the biological pathways linking WASH and IYCF with linear growth and hemoglobin concentration by measuring domains of EED, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status. Measure the impact of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on incidence, prevalence, and severity of diarrheal disease in infants, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status Model the relative contributions of diarrheal disease and EED in mediating the effects of improved WASH on child length and hemoglobin concentrations, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status  Measure the strength of association between severity of maternal EED and systemic inflammation during pregnancy with the risk of 6 adverse  birth outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, fetal stunting, low birth weight and neonatal death), stratified by maternal HIV status. Measure the strength of association between other potential causes of stunting and anemia (other than poorWASH or IYCF) with linear growth and hemoglobin.    Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The SHINE study was conducted in the contiguous districts of Chirumanzu and Shurugwi in Zimbabwe. These districts were chosen based of the following criteria:         Rural districts with low sanitation coverage (53% for these districts, with 45% open defecation) High prevalence of child stunting (mean LAZ at 18 months and 24 months, -1.89 and -1.97) Reasonable road access throughout the year District level primary healthcare services that offer facility-based antenatal care and deliveries  Geographically contiguousness Stakeholder receptivity     Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - June 2017        Study Design: SHINE was a cluster-randomized, community-base 2 x 2 factoral trial in two contiguous districts in Zimbabwe. The study area was divided into 212 clusters. Each clusters were allocated (1:1:1:1) to one of the four treatment groups: (1) standard of care, (2) infant and young child feeding, (3) WASH or (4) sanitation/hygiene and nutrition.         Eligibility Criteria: Women were eligible for inclusion if they permanently resided in a study cluster and were confirmed pregnant. During the recruitment period, the cutoff of gestational age for eligibility was gradually loosened (from 14 weeks' gestational age to just before parturition) to maximise recruitment.        Study Arms:  In the standard-of-care group, village health workers promoted exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, advised on neonatal care, and promoted uptake of Ministry of Health and Child Care services, including antenatal care, immunizations, and family planning. In the WASH group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages, plus information about safe disposal of feces, handwashing with soap at key times, protection of infants from geophagia and ingestion of animal feces, chlorination of drinking water (especially for infants), and hygienic preparation of complementary food. Additionally, ventilated improved pit latrines were constructed and two handwashing stations were installed by community builders supervised by Ministry of Health and Child Care environmental health technicians within 6 weeks of enrolment. A plastic mat and play yard were delivered to the home by a trial logistician at 2 and 6 months postnatal, respectively, and village health workers made monthly deliveries of soap from the time of the handwashing module (roughly 30 weeks antenatal) and chlorine from the time of the water treatment module (4 months postnatal) until 18 months postnatal. In the IYCF group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages plus information about the importance of nutrition for infant health, growth, and development; feeding nutrient-dense food and 20 g of a small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement daily from age 6 to 18 months; processing foods to facilitate mastication and swallowing; feeding during illness; and dietary diversity. Participants also received monthly deliveries of 30 sachets of the small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement from infant age 6 months to 18 months postnatal. In the combined group, participants received all standard-of-care, WASH, and IYCF interventions.   Data Collection: Research nurses made home visits at baseline (roughly 2 weeks after mothers provided consent), 32 weeks' gestation, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post partum to assess maternal and household characteristics and trial outcomes. Intervention uptake was assessed at all visits and reported here as prespecified for the 12-month postnatal visit. At baseline, mothers' height, weight, mid-upper-arm circumference, and haemoglobin concentrations were measured. They were also tested for Schistosoma haematobium (by urinary microscopy) and HIV (via the rapid test algorithm). Other maternal and household characteristics assessed included dietary diversity, food insecurity, household wealth, and maternal capabilities.

clinepidb_DS_0605f599e5	ClinEpiDB	VIDA Case Control	Related studies   GEMS1 Case Control Study VIDA HUCS Gambia Mali Survey VIDA HUCS Kenya Survey    Background: Despite considerable progress in reducing diarrhea-related mortality over the past two decades, diarrheal diseases remain the second leading cause of post-neonatal death during the first 5 years of life in developing countries. As further declines are made possible by expanding interventions that target the principal causes of severe disease, the availability of accurate, up-to-date assessments at the country level are essential to guide strategic planning and resource allocation.               During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. However, the impact of vaccine introduction on the epidemiology of diarrheal diseases will likely extend beyond changes in rotavirus-associated morbidity and mortality alone; shifts in the predominant pathogens and adverse outcomes associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) are also expected.        Objectives:  To assess the impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction on the:         Etiology of MSD, by comparing the number and proportion of MSD cases with specific pathogens before rotavirus vaccine introduction (i.e., during GEMS) and in the study period, as well as comparing adjusted pathogen-specific incidence and attributable fraction Adverse clinical consequences of MSD, measured as the linear growth attainment and mortality during a 2-3 month follow-up period after study enrollment Overall incidence of MSD As an exploratory objective, diarrhea- associated under-5 mortality in the DSS population measured using verbal autopsy    To provide a well-characterized library of stool samples for analysis by TaqMan®, a highly sensitive, quantitative molecular assay to more precisely define the pathogen-specific diarrheal disease burden  To determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case-control study design with two separate control populations:  rotavirus test-negative cases with MSD, and matched community controls. Additional information that can be gleaned from the case-control study includes:        Effectiveness of a partial course of rotavirus vaccine Duration of protection Presence of protection in children too young to receive vaccine (herd immunity) Potential risk factors for vaccine failure, including nutritional status, concomitant infection with enteropathogens that may modulate the immune system or the expression of diarrheal symptoms, such as Giardia, soil helminths, and H. pylori    To test whether genetic mutations in histo-blood group antigens FUT2 (secretor) and FUT3 (Lewis) are associated with an increased risk of moderate-to-severe rotavirus diarrhea, among vaccinated children   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in three GEMS sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali; Basse, The Gambia, and Siaya County, Kenya- that share the observation in GEMS that rotavirus is the most important pathogen in during the first 2 years of life. All three countries recently introduced rotavirus vaccine but vary with respect to the vaccine introduced. Mali and The Gambia are using RotaTeq while Kenya introduced Rotarix. The sites all have moderate-to-high under 5 mortality rates, but differ with respect to setting (urban vs. rural), disease burden (rotavirus incidence and MSD-associated mortality rates), co-morbidities that could affect vaccine take (HIV and malaria transmission, malnutrition), and health indicators that might reflect healthcare quality and utilization.          Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018        Study Design: Case-Control study          Eligibility Criteria:    Cases: Cases with a new episode (onset after at least 7 diarrhea-free days) of acute diarrhea (≥3 loose stools in 24 hours lasting fewer than 7 days) seeking care at sentinel health care centers at each site were evaluated for MSD. Diarrhea cases with one of the following criteria were considered to be MSD: 1) sunken eyes, 2) loss of skin turgor, 3) intravenous hydration prescribed, 4) hospitalization recommended, or 5) dysentery. MSD cases were enrolled in 3 age strata: 0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months.        Controls: One to three matched diarrhea-free controls were identified through the Demographic Surveillance System at each site and enrolled at their homes. Controls were matched by residence (same or nearby village or community), sex, age group, and time (enrolled within 14 days of case enrollment).          Data Collection: Data was collected at enrollment and at a 60-day follow-up visit.           Enrollment visit: Demographic factors including child's age, household size and composition, cooking fuel, access to improved water and sanitation, household possessions, household construction, parental educational attainment, breastfeeding, anthropometric measurements, vaccination information. A single, fresh, whole stool specimen was collected from both cases and controls at enrollment. A saliva sample was collected from eligible VIDA cases and their matched controls. Diarrheal history, physical examination, and visit outcome data was collected only for cases. 60-day follow-up visit: Standardized questionnaire to ascertain the vital status and health of the child- child's axillary temperature, anthropometric measurements; standardized observations about water and sanitation facilities.

clinepidb_DS_08b80ee6ae	ClinEpiDB	Amazonia ICEMR2- Brazil Rio Azul	Background: Malaria remains common among native Amazonians, challenging Brazil′s elimination efforts.      Objectives: We examined the epidemiology of malaria in riverine populations of the country′s main hotspot, the upper Juruá Valley in Acre state close to the Brazil-Peru border, where Plasmodium vivax accounts for >80% of cases.      Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Municipality of Mâncio Lima, in the upper Juruá Valley region of Acre state, westernmost Brazil, close to the border with Peru.       Dates of Data Collection: The first survey was carried out between 9-12 July, 2018; the second survey was carried out between 9-12 July, 2019.       Study Design: Prosepective panel study      Eligibility: The participants must have met the following criteria- Permanent residents in riverine communities situated along Azul River, Acre, Brazil.       Data Collection: For the first survey in 2018, 246 individuals aged between 1 and 72 years were invited to provide a finger-prick blood sample. For the second survey 2019, 244 participants aged < 1-75 years, coming from nine villages, were interviewed using the same structured questionnaire applied in 2018.           Overall, we enrolled 386 individuals and tested 262 (67.9%) of them for malaria parasites during at least one survey; 36 (9.3%) participants were tested during both surveys. Those who reported recent signs or symptoms at or up to 7 days were classified as “symptomatic”.           The first survey, 2018: house-to-house visits (in 10 riverine villages or “communities” on the banks of the Azul River, a tributary of the Moa River, all of them originated from former rubber-tapper settlements: Três Unidos, Valparaíso, Barro Vermelho, Belo Horizonte, Buritis, Nova Lição, Bom Sossego, Bela Vista, Bom Jesus and Queimadas) by using structured questionnaire to obtain sociodemographic and morbidity information. In addition, finger-prick blood sample from the participants was collected as well.           For the second survey 2019, residents in the area were invited to attend medical and dental care, routine vaccination and cervical cancer screening in health posts or schools situated in one of three largest villages (Três Unidos, Nova Lição and Bom Sossego), using the same structured questionnaire applied in 2018 and finger-prick blood sample.           Laboratory Methods:     Thick blood smears were stained with Giemsa and had at least 100 fields examined for malaria parasites, under 1,000x magnification, by an experienced microscopist. P. vivax infections diagnosed by onsite microscopy were treated with chloroquine (25 mg/kg of body weight over 3 days) and primaquine (3.5 mg/kg over 7 days); Plasmodium falciparum infections were treated with a 3-day course of artemether (2 to 4 mg/kg/day) plus lumefantrine (12 to 24 mg/kg/day) and a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg primaquine for gametocyte clearance.           Molecular screening for malaria was carried out with a genus-specific, SYBR Green-based quantitative PCR. Positive samples were further tested with newly designed TaqMan assays that target species-specific cytb gene fragments.

clinepidb_DS_51b40fe2e2	ClinEpiDB	PRISM2 ICEMR Cohort	Related Studies:   PRISM ICEMR Cohort   Background: The second Program for Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance and Modeling of Malaria in Uganda (PRISM2) study is from the East Africa International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research. Data from the longitudinal cohort in Nagongera sub-county, Uganda, including corresponding entomological surveillance data, are included in ClinEpiDB.        Objectives:   Estimating the incidence of malaria, parasite prevalence, and the molecular force of infection among cohort study participants Characterizing factors that determine the malarial force of infection Determining factors that affect the duration, density, and clinical consequences of blood stage malaria infection Assessing the associations between overnight travel and the risk of malaria infection Estimating measures of transmission intensity including the human biting rate, sporozoite rate, and the entomological inoculation rate at the household level Characterizing the species composition of mosquito vectors and the host source of mosquito blood meals Identifing pathogens responsible for non-malarial febrile illness among cohort study participants   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Nagongera Sub-County, Tororo District, Uganda        Dates of Data Collection: October 2017 - October 2019        Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with active and passive malaria case detection and entomological surveillance        Eligibility Criteria: Households (defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling structure acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) came from two separate sources: 1) Households that were followed in the previous surveillance study (see the PRISM ICEMR Cohort), 2) new households that were randomly selected from an enumeration list of all households in Nagongera sub-county generated in 2011. Using a computerized number generator, a random sample of households from the enumeration list were selected for screening and approached in the order in which they were selected. Households from the previous study were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria:        At least two members of the household aged 5 years or younger No more than 7 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies         New households selected from the enumeration list were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria:         At least two members of the household under 10 years of age No more than 9 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies         Participants were enrolled if they met the following eligibility criteria:         Household considered their primary residence Agreement to come to the study clinic for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications outside the study Provision of written informed consent (for parent or guardian in case of children)         The cohort was dynamic, so any permanent residents that joined the household were screened for enrollment. Participants were withdrawn from the study if they met any of the following criteria:        Permanently moved out of Nagongera sub-county Unable to be located for >4 months Withdrew informed consent Unable to comply with study schedule and procedures   Data Collection:   Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all participants underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear. A household survey was the conducted to collect household-level information on the use of malaria interventions and treatment-seeking practices. All households were given a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN).        Cohort Study Follow-Up: Routine visits at the study clinic occurred once every 4 weeks and included a standardized evaluation. At each routine visit, participants under 6 months had blood collected by a finger prick/heel stick and those over 6 months had a venipuncture with 2.5-15 mL of blood collected based on their weight. Blood was used for a thick blood smear, to measure hemoglobin levels (every 12 weeks), for filter paper samples, and stored for additional studies.              Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinic open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill. For any participant presenting to the clinic (for a routine or non-routine visit) with documented fever (tympanic temp >= 38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.        Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted every 2 weeks in each household. A collection was done in all rooms where study participants slept. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning. Presence and use of LLINs was also recorded. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or "other") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. Members of the An. gambiae complex were identified by PCR. Sporozoites were identified in individual mosquitoes stored with desiccant using ELISA.        Population Level Vector Control Interventions: Universal Long-lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN) campaigns were carried out in November 2013 and June 2017. There have been 7 rounds of district wide indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide. Bendiocarb was administered December 2014-January 2015, June-July 2015, and November-December 2015. Actellic (pirimiphos-methyl) was administered June-July 2016, July-August 2017, June-July 2018, and March-April 2019.

The data presented in ClinEpiDB include the longitudinal cohort and entomological surveillance component of the PRISM study.           Objectives:  Perform comprehensive surveillance studies aimed to improve understanding of malaria and measure the impact of population-level control interventions Bring together expertise from multiple disciplines to collect data across multiple levels, reflecting the complex nature of interactions between the mosquito vector, malaria parasite and human host Assess transmission in three sites, ranging from areas of relatively low transmission intensity to areas with some of the highest transmission intensities recorded in the world Emphasize local training and capacity building, transfer of technology, and building strong relationships between researchers and policymakers  Methodology:   Geographic Location/Study Sites: Uganda, Walukuba (Jinja District), Kihihi (Kanungu District), Nagongera (Tororo District)            Dates of Data Collection: August 2011-June 2017. Note that participants from Walukuba and Kihihi sub-counties were followed through June 30, 2016 while participants from Nagongera sub-county were followed for an extra year, through June 30, 2017.          Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with passive and active malaria case detection and entomological surveillance          Eligibility Criteria: All households in each sub-county were enumerated and mapped (households were defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) from January - June 2011. Using a computerized number generator, random samples of households from each sub-county were approached consecutively, and 100 households were enrolled per site from August - September 2011 into both the entomologic surveys and cohort studies if they met the following criteria:          At least one household resident 0.5-10 years of age At least one adult resident available for providing informed consent 300 households (100 per site) were enrolled Aug-Sept 2011 and an additional 31 households were enrolled Aug-Sept 2013 to replace households withdrawn during the 1st two years of follow-up           All children and up to one primary caregiver from each household were enrolled into the cohort study if they met the following eligibility criteria:          Documented age between 6 months and <10 years for children Full time resident of the household No intention to move out of the sub-county for the next two years Agreement to come to a dedicated study clinic located within the sub-county for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications administered outside this study Provision of written informed consent from parent or guardian           Cohorts were dynamic - all newly eligible children were enrolled and study participants reaching 11 years of age were excluded from further follow-up. Study participants were withdrawn from the study based on:          Permanent movement out of the sub-county Inability to be located for > 4 months Withdrawal of informed consent Inability to comply with the study schedule and procedures Child reaching 11 years of age A household was withdrawn when all cohort study participants from the household were withdrawn.  Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months. In subset of children starting in December 2014, routine blood smears were done every month.            Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted once a month in each household participating in the cohort studies. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot end of the bed where a cohort study participant slept.

clinepidb_DS_13c737a528	ClinEpiDB	South Asia ICEMR Surveillance	Background: Passive surveillance of malaria cases was conducted at both public and private primary health centers (PHCs) and tertiary hospitals across India.          Objectives: The objectives were to observe the clinical severity of malaria cases and correlate them with various parasite phenotypes and genotypes.          Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was located in four different sites in India: 1) Goa state; 2) Wardha, Maharashtra; 3) Ranchi, Jharkhand; and 4) Northeast Region (Assam, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh states). Currently, only data from Goa is available through ClinEpiDB.          Dates of Data Collection: April 2012 to June 2017          Study Design: Health center surveillance across four diverse locations in India          Eligibility Criteria: Febrile patients presenting to the surveillance sites across India were screened for malaria. If malaria positive via rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy slide, a patient was invited to consent to participate in the study if s/he was between the ages of 12 months and 65 years, did not have a hemoglobin level less than 7 g/dL and was not suspected to be pregnant.          Data Collection: Study participants donated 4-6 mL of venous blood, provided a body temperature reading and answered a series of questions about their demographics, travel history, malaria infection history and treatment regimen. If s/he was treated on an outpatient basis, the patient's participation concluded after a single study visit. If s/he was treated on an inpatient basis, the study participant was followed daily until discharge. Each daily study visit consisted of recording of clinical observations and biochemical tests routinely performed by the hospital as well as documentation of the patient's treatment regimen.                  The venous blood samples donated by each study participant were used to produce clinical and parasitological parameters as well as to help answer basic questions about malaria biology.           ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as flat files. These datasets were merged by unique ID and redundant or administrative columns were dropped from presentation on ClinEpiDB.org. All dates were obfuscated per participant through the application of a random number algorithm that shifted dates no more than seven days to comply with the ethical conduct of human subjects research.

clinepidb_DS_6741e4cc0a	ClinEpiDB	VIDA HUCS Gambia Mali Survey	Related studies   VIDA Case Control Study VIDA HUCS Kenya    Background: Despite considerable progress in reducing diarrhea-related mortality over the past two decades, diarrheal diseases remain the second leading cause of post-neonatal death during the first 5 years of life in developing countries. During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD).              At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study.        Objectives:  To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study. Mali and The Gambia recently introduced the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine.        Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018        Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study        Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.         Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria-  Age 0-59 months Belongs to the DSS Randomly selected from the DSS database  Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview.        Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. The parent/primary caretaker of each selected child was asked whether the child had diarrhea in the previous 7 days. If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where. An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage.  The child's vaccination card was examined and the dates that the child received vaccines against rotavirus, oral polio, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus containing vaccine, and the EPI center attended were recorded.

In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of children from three age strata was selected and the HUCS was conducted by the DSS team during their routine rounds. The goal of the survey was to assess rotavirus vaccine coverage and to determine where children in the DSS seek care for moderate-to-severe diarrhea.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Case control study design - Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) - Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) - Observational cross-sectional study design - Data sampling - Questionnaire administration - Documentation on ClinEpiDB - Data integration into ClinEpiDB
clinepidb_DS_40a4b145f4	ClinEpiDB	Preventing Congenital Syphilis Cluster Randomized Trial	Background: Maternal syphilis is associated with stillbirths, perinatal deaths, prematurity, and congenital infections and remains a major global concern, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. In 2012, among women who were estimated to be likely to have active syphilis, only 3% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 24% in Zambia were treated. In contrast, the WHO recommends that coverage of syphilis testing and treatment of positive cases among pregnant women should each be at least 95% in order to eliminate mother-to-child transmission.              While there is evidence that insufficient access to supplies hinders screening and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy in low-resource settings, additional interventions might be needed to overcome barriers related to health providers' behaviors regarding treatment and increase the likelihood that the supplies are used. This study assessed whether a multifaceted behavioral intervention based on previous research experience combined with the provision of supplies was more effective than providing supplies only to improve syphilis screening and treatment in seropositive pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Lusaka (Zambia).        Objectives: The primary objectives of the study were to determine if behavioral interventions 1) improved the likelihood that women were screened for syphilis at their first antenatal care visit, and 2) for those who screened positive, whether they were more likely to receive syphilis treatment at their first antenatal care visit. Secondary objectives included assessing:        The frequency with which women received screening for HIV at their first antenatal care visit The frequency with which women received screening for anemia at their first antenatal care visit The frequency with which women received screening for proteinuria at their first antenatal care visit   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: 16 antenatal care clinics in the Maluku and Nsele health areas, located in the capital city-province of Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were included in baseline data collection. 10 of those antenatal care clinics were included in the intervention phase. 10 clinics in health areas located within the capital province of Lusaka, Zambia were included in baseline data collection and the intervention phase.          Dates of Data Collection: Baseline data collection was conducted from April 1, 2015 to January 13, 2016 in the DRC and from April 13, 2015 to January 10, 2016 in Zambia. The intervention phase was conducted from February 1, 2016 to July 14, 2017 in the DRC and from February 8, 2016 to July 14, 2017 in Zambia.          Study Design: Cluster randomized trial          Eligibility Criteria: All pregnant women attending their first antenatal care visit at the participating clinics who consented to participate were eligible to be enrolled, irrespective of their gestational age. Antenatal care was defined as care during pregnancy before the initiation of labor. A first antenatal care visit was defined as the first visit in the participating facility during the current pregnancy.          Study Arms: All clinics received supplies for screening and treating syphilis, including rapid tests, benzathine penicillin, and anaphylaxis adverse reaction treatment, as well as training on using rapid tests. The intervention arm additionally received a multifaceted strategy consisting of:           Identification and training of opinion leaders among prenatal health providers, who disseminated, implemented, and maintained the best evidence practices using reminders, monitoring, and feedback. The goal was that facilitators learn: 1) priority health conditions to be screened and treated during pregnancy; 2) how to screen and manage maternal syphilis; and 3) how to effectively implement the congenital syphilis prevention program at the clinics in order to ensure all eligible women are screened and treated and that standard partner management is done. Packaging the supplies in kits: Point-of-care rapid test kits for syphilis diagnosis with instructions for immediate treatment, if positive; Treatment kits (benzathine penicillin 2.4 MU, syringe and needle, instructions, and information on side-effects); Anaphylaxis treatment kits for emergency use if needed (resources to treat an anaphylaxis adverse reaction according to local practice guidelines). Information on monitoring the availability of rapid tests and ensuring the availability of benzathine penicillin and anaphylaxis adverse reaction treatment.           Prenatal health providers at control clinics were invited to participate in a half-day training workshop where they were given refresher concepts on the prenatal care package and maternal and congenital syphilis and were trained in syphilis case detection and management, using standard and available screening methods.           Randomization: Baseline data was used in a covariate-adjusted randomization procedure (Ivers et al., 2012) to balance the intervention and control groups in regards to: (1) Number of first antenatal care visits; (2) Number of women screened for syphilis; (3) Number of women with a positive test for syphilis; (4) Number of first antenatal care visits per provider; (5) Percentage of women screened for syphilis; (6) Percentage of women positive for syphilis; (7) Country; (8) Type of Clinic.           Data Collection: Data regarding the participant's obstetric and syphilis history as well as testing for syphilis, HIV, proteinuria, and anemia were collected at a participant's first antenatal care visit for their current pregnancy. Data were obtained from source documents such as antenatal care log books, antenatal cards, prevention of mother-to-child transmission books, laboratory log books, and nursing log books. Data not available in source documents were collected by interviewing the women. Participants with a positive test for syphilis who did not receive treatment during the first visit were followed up by study personnel until their estimated date of delivery to ensure that all infected women received treatment before delivery. Participants were contacted at the subsequent antenatal care visits or by phone. The list of seropositive women who did not receive treatment at the first visit was communicated monthly to the country principal investigators to be shared with local health authorities.

clinepidb_DS_6a93753102	ClinEpiDB	GEMS1A HUAS Lite Survey	Related studies:   GEMS1A Case Control GEMS1 HUAS/HUAS Lite Survey GEMS1 Case Control    Background: The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) 1A HUAS Lite surveys was a community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Survey (HUAS) conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1A Case Control study. The survey is a shortened version of the original GEMS1 HUAS survey and provides data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment.        Objectives: Data from the GEMS1 1A HUAS Lite surveys was used in different ways,        To optimize the surveillance for determining disease burden To perform data adjustments to account for the proportion of children with diarrhea who do not seek care at the health care facilities participating in GEMS surveillance To calculate population-based incidence rates To compare data between the different sites To assess public perception of the need for interventions to prevent childhood diarrhea   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites:Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS1A HUAS Lite, four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).          Dates of Data Collection: December 2010- August 2011; Per protocol, each GEMS1A site conducted surveys of health care services utilization and attitudes twice a year over the course of the study.        Study Design: Community-based Cross-sectional Survey        Eligibility Criteria: Many of the HUAS Lite methods are adapted from the Generic protocol for a community-based survey on utilization of health care services for gastroenteritis in children under 5 years of age.(World Health Organization. Generic protocols for: i) hospital-based surveillance to estimate the burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis in children and ii) a community-based survey on utilization of health care services for gastroenteritis in children. Geneva: WHO; 2002.)               However, since the catchment population at each site will have had a recent census and ongoing demographic surveillance, it was possible to randomly select children 0-59 months of age to participate in the HUAS Lite. From the census at each study site, updated by the ongoing surveillance, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). The census database thus should have been as current as possible, in order to include recent births and to put children who have crossed an age group boundary in the appropriate group. The list defines the population from which the HUAS sample is drawn.        Data Collection: The interviewer went to the child's home and described the study to the selected child's parent or primary caretaker. If the parent or primary caretaker wished to participate, the consent form was read aloud by the interviewer in the local language and the parent/primary caretaker was given an opportunity to ask questions. Thereafter, s/he would either provide a signature or (if s/he did not know how to write) place a mark on the consent form (this could be an "x" or a fingerprint) in the presence of a witness (who would also sign the form) indicating his/her willingness to participate. The parent or primary caretaker received a copy of the signed consent form to keep and the original was stored in the regulatory files at the study site. The respondent was the child's primary caretaker. If a primary caretaker was not available, this was recorded and the interviewer tried to leave a message indicating when the interviewer would be likely to return. A total of 3 attempts were made to contact a primary caretaker after which time the child was considered a nonresponder.              A new HUAS Lite questionnaire was to be used for each child contacted. The data collected from the ~20 questions asked include information about the household and family composition, occurrence of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices.         Study documentation:    HUAS Lite Questionnaire   The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) 1A HUAS Lite surveys were 2 community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Surveys (HUAS Lite and HUAS Lite - Kenya) conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1A case control study. This cross-sectional survey provides data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention, and treatment.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Cross-sectional Survey - Geospatial Analysis - Data Collection through Interviews - Random Selection of Participants - Census Database Construction - Consent Form Signing and Witnessing - Data Storage and Regulatory Filing
clinepidb_DS_f559aee789	ClinEpiDB	Namibia rfMDA RAVC Cluster Randomized Trial - EDA data for QA	Background: In low-endemic malaria settings, screening and       treatment near malaria index cases (reactive case detection, RACD) is practiced for surveillance and response. However, since the effectiveness of RACD is limited by the low sensitivity of point-of-care tests to detect low-density chronic infections that perpetuate malaria transmission, other approaches may be more effective.         Objectives: This cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in a low endemic setting to evaluate the impact of two reactive focal malaria interventions - reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA) and reactive focal vector control (RAVC). The objectives were to:          Evaluate the effectiveness of rfMDA, RAVC, and their combination to decrease malaria        transmission Evaluate the safety of rfMDA and RAVC, alone and in combination    Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Zambezi Region, Namibia        Dates of Data Collection: January 2017-December 2017        Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled open label two-by-two       factorial design trial        Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study intervention are shown below:          Study Arms: Fifty-six census enumeration area (EA) clusters were randomized to: 1) RACD or rfMDA, and 2) RAVC or no RAVC.          RACD: rapid diagnostic testing and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine        (AL) rfMDA: presumptive treatment with AL RAVC: indoor residual spraying using pirimiphos-methyl    Data Collection: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting the parasite reservoir in humans (rfMDA versus RACD), in mosquitos (RAVC versus no RAVC), and in both humans and mosquitoes (rfMDA plus RAVC versus RACD only) on the primary outcome of cluster-level cumulative incidence of locally acquired malaria cases, an intention-to-treat analysis was performed.              Interventions were administered to the target population within 500 meters of an index case, as randomized. Index cases were defined as passively detected malaria cases that were confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy, irrespective of origin (e.g. local or imported), who were confirmed to reside in or have stayed at least one night in study EA in the previous four weeks. Data on malaria incidence and epidemiological data such as demographics, residence location, travel history, and malaria prevention behavior were collected.               Field teams aimed to visit the index case household and eligible neighboring households within seven days but up to five weeks from the report of an index case, prioritizing households that were closest to the index case. To cover ≥80% of individuals or households within 500 meters of index cases, field teams aimed to deliver RACD or rfMDA to at least 25 individuals and RAVC (if indicated) to at least 7 households.               Epidemiological data were collected on password secured tablets with pre-coded questionnaires programmed in Open Data Kit (ODK version 1.23.3). Tablet data was uploaded to a secure, firewall- and password-protected server. During the RACD intervention and during the endline cross-sectional survey, consenting individuals received malaria RDT testing and a dried blood spot (DBS) was collected for laboratory testing.

S-EPMC2782860	OmicsDI	Selection of parasites with diminished drug susceptibility by amodiaquine-containing antimalarial regimens in Uganda.	Amodiaquine (AQ) is paired with artesunate (AS) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in recommended antimalarial regimens. It is unclear how readily AQ resistance will be selected with combination chemotherapy.We collected 61 Plasmodium falciparum samples from a cohort of Ugandan children randomized for treatment with AQ-SP, AS-AQ, or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for uncomplicated malaria. In vitro susceptibility to monodesethylamodiaquine (MDAQ) was measured with a histidine-rich protein 2-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and potential resistance-mediating polymorphisms in pfmdr1 were evaluated.Parasites collected from patients treated with AQ-SP or AS-AQ within the prior 12 weeks were less susceptible to MDAQ (n = 18; mean of the median inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], 62.9 nmol/L; range, 12.7-158.3 nmol/L) than were parasites from those not treated within 12 weeks (n = 43; mean IC(50), 37.5 nmol/L; range, 6.3-184.7 nmol/L; P=.009) or only from those patients in the treatment arm that did not receive AQ (n = 12; mean IC(50), 28.8 nmol/L; range, 6.3-121.8 nmol/L; P = .004). The proportion of strains with polymorphisms expected to mediate diminished response to AQ (pfmdr1 86Y and 1246Y) increased after AQ therapy, although differences were not statistically significant.Prior therapy selected for diminished response to MDAQ, which suggests that AQ-containing regimens may rapidly lose efficacy in Africa. The mechanism of diminished MDAQ response is not fully explained by known mutations in pfmdr1.	gpt-3.5-turbo	1. Histidine-rich protein 2-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2.

S-EPMC7432349	OmicsDI	Investigating the Vascular Toxicity Outcomes of the Irreversible Proteasome Inhibitor Carfilzomib.	BACKGROUND:Carfilzomib's (Cfz) adverse events in myeloma patients include cardiovascular toxicity. Since carfilzomib's vascular effects are elusive, we investigated the vascular outcomes of carfilzomib and metformin (Met) coadministration. METHODS:Mice received: (i) saline; (ii) Cfz; (iii) Met; (iv) Cfz+Met for two consecutive (acute) or six alternate days (subacute protocol). Leucocyte-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) and serum NOx levels were determined and aortas underwent vascular and molecular analyses. Mechanistic experiments were recapitulated in aged mice who received similar treatment to young animals. Primary murine (prmVSMCs) and aged human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) underwent Cfz, Met and Cfz+Met treatment and viability, metabolic flux and p53-LC3-B expression were measured. Experiments were recapitulated in AngII, CoCl2 and high-glucose stimulated HAoSMCs. RESULTS:Acutely, carfilzomib alone led to vascular hypo-contraction and increased ROS release. Subacutely, carfilzomib increased ROS release without vascular manifestations. Cfz+Met increased PGF2?-vasoconstriction and LC3-B-dependent autophagy in both young and aged mice. In vitro, Cfz+Met led to cytotoxicity and autophagy, while Met and Cfz+Met shifted cellular metabolism. CONCLUSION:Carfilzomib induces a transient vascular impairment and oxidative burst.

S-EPMC5123166	OmicsDI	Facial Dystonia with Facial Grimacing and Vertical Gaze Palsy with "Round the Houses" Sign in a 29-Year-Old Woman.	A 29-year-old woman developed progressive dysarthria and coordination problems from the age of 15. Examination showed dysarthria, facial dystonia, bibrachial dystonia, hyperreflexia, ataxia, and emotional incontinence. Downward supranuclear gaze palsy was prominent with a "Round the Houses" sign. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and medulla, electroneurography, and cerebrospinal fluid were normal. A computed tomography scan showed hepatosplenomegaly. This combination of progressive neurological symptoms together with hepatosplenomegaly was suggestive of inborn error of metabolism. A bone marrow biopsy showed an increased number of macrophages with foamy content, highly suggestive of lysosomal disease. Plasmatic chitotriosidase activity and CCL18 were increased. Genetic testing showed heterozygosis for the variation c.1070C?T (p.Ser357Leu) and c.1843?T (Arg615Cys), confirming the diagnosis of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). The "Round the Houses" sign has only been described in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). This sign is described as an inability to produce pure vertical saccades along the midline and instead moving the eyes in a lateral arc to accomplish the movement. The observation of this sign in a patient with NPC indicates that this bedside finding is not specific for PSP, but a sign of medial longitudinal fasciculus dysfunction. The presence of facial dystonia with facial grimacing together with supranuclear gaze palsy is highly characteristic and useful for the diagnosis of NPC. NPC is an important underdiagnosed condition, given the availability of treatment and a mean diagnostic delay of 6 years.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Magnetic resonance imaging - Electroneurography - Computed tomography scan - Bone marrow biopsy - Plasmatic chitotriosidase activity - Genetic testing

S-EPMC4323837	OmicsDI	Blood lipids and the incidence of atrial fibrillation: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the Framingham Heart Study.	Dyslipidemia is a major contributor to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary disease. Its role in the etiology of atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncertain.We studied 7142 men and women from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Framingham Heart Study who did not have prevalent AF at baseline and were not on lipid-lowering medications. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured using standard procedures. Incident AF during follow-up was identified from hospital discharge codes; review of medical charts; study electrocardiograms; and, in MESA only, Medicare claims. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of AF by clinical categories of blood lipids in each cohort. Study-specific results were meta-analyzed using inverse of variance weighting. During 9.6 years of mean follow-up, 480 AF cases were identified. In a combined analysis of multivariable-adjusted results from both cohorts, high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with lower AF risk (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.87 in those with levels ?60 mg/dL versus <40 mg/dL), whereas high triglycerides were associated with higher risk of AF (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.05 in those with levels ?200 mg/dL versus <150 mg/dL). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not associated with the risk of AF.In these 2 community-based cohorts, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total cholesterol were associated with the risk of AF, accounting for other cardiometabolic risk factors.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Measurement of blood lipids - Standard procedures for cholesterol measurement - Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models - Meta-analysis using inverse of variance weighting - Review of medical charts - Review of hospital discharge codes - Review of study electrocardiograms - Review of Medicare claims
E-GEOD-61150	OmicsDI	Aberrant DNA methylation in rhabdomyosarcoma	Many pediatric malignancies are embryonal in nature, and one hypothesis for the origin of embryonal tumors is that they arise from a defect in differentiation, either by an inability to terminally differentiate or a reversion to a pluripotent state. There is emerging evidence that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the transition from embryonic stem cell to a more committed cell fate, utilizing both de novo DNA methylation and poised ‘bivalent’ chromatin domains (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) to abolish pluripotency and gain lineage- and cell-type-specific characteristics as a cell differentiates. Thus inappropriate epigenetic silencing by aberrant DNA methylation of bivalent genes required for differentiation could lead to the uncontrolled cell growth observed in cancer. Our broad hypothesis is that aberrant DNA methylation in cancer is targeted to a non-random subset of critical pathways used in normal development. This dysregulation of the normal epigenetic program used in development promotes cellular proliferation and provides a mechanism to block differentiation in pediatric cancers, such as rhabdomyosarcoma. Examination of DNA methylation in fourteen human rhabdomyosarcoma patient samples using RRBS. In addition, RRBS was used to examine DNA methylation in one human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) forced to terminally differentiate by expression of the forced heterodimer MyoD~E12 (MDE).

S-EPMC6478895	OmicsDI	Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 Induces A20 Expression via Toll-Like Receptor 2 Signaling and Inhibits the Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Activation of Nuclear Factor-kappa B and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases in Peritoneal Macrophages.	Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 (LH2171) has been reported to ameliorate the development of autoimmune diseases, such as collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalitis in mice and inhibit interleukin (IL)-6 production in antigen-presenting cells in vitro. Regulation of cytokine production by antigen-presenting cells might be critical for the anti-inflammatory function of LH2171 in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanism and contributing components of LH2171-mediated inhibition of IL-6 production are unclear. Here, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of LH2171 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, as a model of antigen-presenting cells, necessary for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. LH2171 significantly reduced LPS-induced expression and secretion of IL-6 and IL-1? cytokines. It also inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases (NF-?B/MAPKs). Moreover, LH2171 induced gene expression of several negative regulators of NF-?B/MAPKs. Among these regulators, A20 was strongly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels upon LH2171 treatment. The cell wall fraction of LH2171 also demonstrated a similar increase in A20 gene expression and exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. These results suggest that the cell wall may be one of the anti-inflammatory components of LH2171. Since cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effect of LH2171 was mediated by TLR2 signaling. Specifically, LH2171-mediated IL-6 suppression and A20 upregulation in wild-type macrophages were reversed and significantly reduced in TLR2 knock-out macrophages. These results suggest that LH2171 induces A20 expression via TLR2 signaling, inhibiting the activation of NF-?B/MAPKs and cytokine production in antigen-presenting cells. This might contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of LH2171 on autoimmune diseases.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Gene expression analysis - Protein analysis - Cell wall fraction analysis - Cell culture - Knock-out study

S-EPMC4282465	OmicsDI	A protocol for the subcellular fractionation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using nitrogen cavitation and density gradient centrifugation.	Most protocols for yeast subcellular fractionation involve the use of mechanical shear forces to lyse the spheroplasts produced by the enzymatic digestion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall. These mechanical homogenization procedures often involve the manual use of devices such as the Dounce homogenizer, and so are very operator-dependent and, in consequence, lack reproducibility. Here, we report a highly reproducible method of homogenizing yeast cells based on nitrogen cavitation. This has been optimized to allow efficient release of subcellular compartments that show a high degree of integrity. The protocol remains effective and reproducible across a range of sample volumes and buffer environments. The subsequent separation method, which employs both sucrose and iodixanol density gradients, has been developed to resolve the major membrane-bound compartments of S. cerevisiae. We present an integrated protocol that is fast, facile, robust and efficient and that will enable 'omics' studies of the subcellular compartments of S. cerevisiae and other yeasts.	gpt-3.5-turbo	Nitrogen cavitation, density gradient centrifugation
S-EPMC4976090	OmicsDI	Carbapenem Resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and Other Acinetobacter spp. Causing Neonatal Sepsis: Focus on NDM-1 and Its Linkage to ISAba125.	Carbapenem-resistant determinants and their surrounding genetic structure were studied in Acinetobacter spp. from neonatal sepsis cases collected over 7 years at a tertiary care hospital. Acinetobacter spp. (n = 68) were identified by ARDRA followed by susceptibility tests. Oxacillinases, metallo-?-lactamases (MBLs), extended-spectrum ?-lactamases and AmpCs, were detected phenotypically and/or by PCR followed by DNA sequencing. Transconjugants possessing the bla NDM-1(New Delhi metallo-?-lactamase) underwent further analysis for plasmids, integrons and associated genes. Genetic environment of the carbapenemases were studied by PCR mapping and DNA sequencing. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for sepsis caused by NDM-1-harboring organisms. A. baumannii (72%) was the predominant species followed by A. calcoaceticus (10%), A. lwoffii (6%), A. nosocomialis (3%), A. junni (3%), A. variabilis (3%), A. haemolyticus (2%), and 14TU (2%). Fifty six percent of the isolates were meropenem-resistant. Oxacillinases present were OXA-23-like, OXA-58-like and OXA-51-like, predominately in A. baumannii. NDM-1 was the dominant MBL (22%) across different Acinetobacter spp. Isolates harboring NDM-1 also possessed bla (VIM-2, PER-1, VEB-2, CTX-M-15), armA, aac(6')Ib, aac(6')Ib-cr genes. bla NDM-1was organized in a composite transposon between two copies of ISAba125 in the isolates irrespective of the species. Further, OXA-23-like gene and OXA-58-like genes were linked with ISAba1 and ISAba3 respectively. Isolates were clonally diverse. Integrons were variable in sequence but not associated with carbapenem resistance. Most commonly found genes in the 5' and 3'conserved segment were aminoglycoside resistance genes (aadB, aadA2, aac4'), non-enzymatic chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA1g) and ADP-ribosylation genes (arr2, arr3). Outborn neonates had a significantly higher incidence of sepsis due to NDM-1 harboring isolates than their inborn counterparts. This study demonstrates the significance of both A. baumannii and other species of Acinetobacter in cases of neonatal sepsis over an extended period. Oxacillinases and bla NDM-1 are the major contributors to carbapenem resistance. The dissemination of the bla NDM-1 is likely linked to Tn125 in diverse clones of the isolates.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- ARDRA (Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis) - Susceptibility tests - Phenotypic detection of oxacillinases, metallo-?-lactamases, extended-spectrum ?-lactamases, and AmpCs - PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) followed by DNA sequencing - Transconjugant analysis - Plasmid analysis - Integron analysis - Genetic environment study using PCR mapping and DNA sequencing - Multivariate logistic regression analysis
S-EPMC3615709	OmicsDI	Control of tumor bioenergetics and survival stress signaling by mitochondrial HSP90s.	Tumors successfully adapt to constantly changing intra- and extracellular environments, but the wirings of this process are still largely elusive. Here, we show that heat-shock-protein-90-directed protein folding in mitochondria, but not cytosol, maintains energy production in tumor cells. Interference with this process activates a signaling network that involves phosphorylation of nutrient-sensing AMP-activated kinase, inhibition of rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1, induction of autophagy, and expression of an endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response. This signaling network confers a survival and proliferative advantage to genetically disparate tumors, and correlates with worse outcome in lung cancer patients. Therefore, mitochondrial heat shock protein 90s are adaptive regulators of tumor bioenergetics and tractable targets for cancer therapy.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Protein folding - Phosphorylation - AMP-activated kinase - mTOR complex 1 inhibition - Autophagy induction - Endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response - Survival and proliferative advantage analysis - Correlation analysis
S-EPMC6474821	OmicsDI	Structural Basis for Graded Inhibition of CREB:DNA Interactions by Multisite Phosphorylation.	Phosphorylation of the kinase inducible domain (KID) of the cyclic AMP response element binding transcription factor (CREB) regulates its function through several mechanisms. Transcriptional activation occurs following phosphorylation at serine 133, but multisite phosphorylation in a neighboring region termed the CK cassette, residues 108-117, results in inhibition of CREB-mediated transcription. A molecular-level understanding of the mechanism of these opposing reactions has been lacking, in part because of the difficulty of preparing multiply phosphorylated CREB in vitro. By substituting a single residue, we have generated an engineered mammalian CREB in which the CK cassette can be phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinases and have characterized its interactions with cyclic AMP response element DNA. Phosphorylation of the CK cassette promotes an intramolecular interaction between the KID domain and the site of DNA binding, the basic region of the C-terminal basic leucine zipper (bZip) domain. Competition between the phosphorylated KID domain and DNA for bZip binding results in a decreased affinity of CREB for DNA. The binding free energy calculated from the dissociation constant is directly proportional to the number of phosphate groups in the CK cassette, indicating that the DNA binding is regulated by a rheostat-like mechanism. The rheostat is modulated by variation of the concentration of cations such as Mg2+ and by alternative isoforms such as the natural CREB isoform that lacks residues 162-272. Multisite phosphorylation of CREB represents a versatile mechanism by which transcription can be tuned to meet the variable needs of the cell.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- X-ray crystallography - Protein engineering - In vitro phosphorylation - DNA binding assays
S-EPMC7073204	OmicsDI	Emerging Potential of Exosomes in Regenerative Medicine for Temporomandibular Joint Osteoarthritis.	Exosomes are nanosized vesicles (30-140 nm) of endocytic origin that play important roles in regenerative medicine. They are derived from cell membranes during endocytic internalization and stabilize in biological fluids such as blood and synovia. Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA) is a degenerative disease, which, in addition to chronic pain, is characterized by progressive cartilage breakdown, condylar bone remodeling, and synovitis. However, traditional clinical treatments have limited symptom- and structure-modifying effects to restore damaged cartilage and other TMJ tissues. This is due to the limited self-healing capacity of condylar cartilage. Recently, stem-cell-derived exosomes have been studied as an alternative therapeutic approach to tissue repair and regeneration. It is known that trophic regulation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects under pathological conditions, and research on MSC-derived exosomes is rapidly accumulating. MSC-derived exosomes mimic the major therapeutic effects of MSCs. They affect the activity of immune effector cells and possess multilineage differentiation potential, including chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, exosomes are capable of regenerating cartilage or osseous compartments and restoring injured tissues and can treat dysfunction and pain caused by TMJ OA. In this review, we looked at the uniqueness of TMJ, the pathogenesis of TMJ OA, and the potential role of MSC-derived exosomes for TMJ cartilage and bone regeneration.	gpt-3.5-turbo	1.

S-EPMC6521571	OmicsDI	Influence of gene modification in biological behaviors and responses of mouse lung telocytes to inflammation.	BACKGROUND:Telocytes play key roles in maintenance of organ/tissue function and prevention of organ injury. However, there are great challenges to investigate telocytes functions using primary telocytes, due to the difficulties of isolation, identification, and stability. The present study aims at constructing continuous cell strain of mouse lung telocyte cell line with stable characters by gene modification and investigating biological behaviors and responses of gene-modified telocytes to inflammation. METHODS:Mouse primary lung telocytes were isolated and identified using immune-labeling markers and immunoelectron microscopy. Primary telocytes were transformed with Simian vacuolating virus 40 small and large T antigen (SV40). Biological characters, behaviors morphology, and proliferation of those gene-modified telocytes were defined and monitored dynamically for 50 generations, as compared with primary lung telocytes. Cell cycle of mouse primary lung telocytes or gene-modified telocytes was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS:Gene modified telocytes of generations 5, 10, 30 and 50 were observed with telopodes and also showed CD34 and ckit positive. Multiple cellular morphology were also observed on telocyte cell-line under monitor of celliq and enhanced cell proliferation were showed. SV40 transduction was also reduced apoptosis and increased the ratio of S and G2 phases in telocyte cell-line. CONCLUSION:We successfully constructed mouse lung telocyte cell-line which maintained the biological properties and behaviors as primary telocytes and could responses to inflammation induced by LPS. Thus, gene-modified lung telocytes, Telocyte Line, would provide a cell tool for researchers exploring the roles and applications of telocytes involved in physiological and pathological states in future.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Isolation and identification of primary lung telocytes - Immune-labeling markers - Immunoelectron microscopy - Transformation with Simian vacuolating virus 40 small and large T antigen - Cell culture monitoring (Celliq) - Flow cytometry
S-EPMC4990225	OmicsDI	Regions of variable DNA methylation in human placenta associated with newborn neurobehavior.	The placenta regulates the in utero environment and functionally impacts fetal development. Candidate gene studies identified variation in placental DNA methylation is associated with newborn neurologic and behavioral outcomes including movement quality, lethargic behavior, attention, and arousal. We sought to identify novel regions of variable DNA methylation associated with newborn attention, lethargy, quality of movement, and arousal by performing an epigenome-wide association study in 335 infants from a US birth cohort. Methylation status was quantified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array and associations to newborn outcomes assessed by the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) were identified while incorporating established bioinformatics algorithms to control for confounding by cell type composition. Methylation of CpGs within FHIT (cg15970800) and ANKRD11 (cg16710656) demonstrated genome-wide significance (P < 1.8 × 10(-7)) in specific associations with infant attention. CpGs whose differential methylation was associated with all 4 neurobehavioral outcomes were common to 50 genes involved in biological processes relating to cellular adhesion and nervous system development. Comprehensive methylation profiling identified relationships between methylation of FHIT and ANKRD11, which have been previously linked to neurodevelopment and behavioral outcomes in genetic association studies. Subtle changes in DNA methylation of these genes within the placenta may impact normal variation of a newborn's ability to alter and track visual and auditory stimuli. Gene ontology analysis suggested that those genes with variable methylation related to these outcomes are over-represented in biological pathways involved in brain development and placental physiology, supportive of our hypothesis for a key role of the placenta in neurobehavioral outcomes.	gpt-3.5-turbo	1.

S-EPMC3246200	OmicsDI	Transposase mediated construction of RNA-seq libraries.	RNA-seq has been widely adopted as a gene-expression measurement tool due to the detail, resolution, and sensitivity of transcript characterization that the technique provides. Here we present two transposon-based methods that efficiently construct high-quality RNA-seq libraries. We first describe a method that creates RNA-seq libraries for Illumina sequencing from double-stranded cDNA with only two enzymatic reactions. We generated high-quality RNA-seq libraries from as little as 10 pg of mRNA (?1 ng of total RNA) with this approach. We also present a strand-specific RNA-seq library construction protocol that combines transposon-based library construction with uracil DNA glycosylase and endonuclease VIII to specifically degrade the second strand constructed during cDNA synthesis. The directional RNA-seq libraries maintain the same quality as the nondirectional libraries, while showing a high degree of strand specificity, such that 99.5% of reads map to the expected genomic strand. Each transposon-based library construction method performed well when compared with standard RNA-seq library construction methods with regard to complexity of the libraries, correlation between biological replicates, and the percentage of reads that align to the genome as well as exons. Our results show that high-quality RNA-seq libraries can be constructed efficiently and in an automatable fashion using transposition technology.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Transposase mediated construction - RNA-seq - cDNA synthesis - Illumina sequencing - Uracil DNA glycosylase - Endonuclease VIII

Cigarette smoking is a common risk factor for developing upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).To assess the impact of cigarette smoking status, cumulative smoking exposure, and time from cessation on oncologic UTUC outcomes in patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU).A total of 864 patients underwent RNU at five institutions. The median follow-up in this retrospective study was 50 mo. Smoking history included smoking status, quantity of cigarettes per day (CPD), duration in years, and years from smoking cessation. The cumulative smoking exposure was categorized as light-short-term (? 19 CPD and ? 19.9 yr), moderate (all combinations except light-short-term and heavy-long-term), and heavy-long-term (? 20 CPD and ? 20 yr).RNU with or without lymph node dissection. No patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Univariable and multivariable logistic regression and competing risk regression analyses assessed the effects of smoking on oncologic outcomes.A total of 244 patients (28.2%) never smoked; 297 (34.4%) and 323 (37.4%) were former and current smokers, respectively. Among smokers, 87 (10.1%), 331 (38.3%), and 202 (23.4%) were light-short-term, moderate, and heavy-long-term smokers, respectively. Current smoking status, smoking ? 20 CPD, ? 20 yr, and heavy-long-term smoking were associated with advanced disease (p values ? 0.004), greater likelihood of disease recurrence (p values ? 0.01), and cancer-specific mortality (p values ? 0.05) on multivariable analyses that adjusted for standard features. Patients who quit smoking ? 10 yr prior to RNU did not differ from never smokers regarding advanced tumor stages, disease recurrence, and cancer-specific mortality, but they had better oncologic outcomes then current smokers and those patients who quit smoking <10 yr prior to RNU. The study is limited by its retrospective nature.Cigarette smoking is significantly associated with advanced disease stages, disease recurrence, and cancer-specific mortality in patients treated with RNU for UTUC. Current smokers and those with a heavy and long-term smoking exposure have the highest risk for poor oncologic outcomes. Smoking cessation >10 yr prior to RNU seems to mitigate some detrimental effects. These results underscore the need for smoking cessation and prevention programs.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Retrospective study - Logistic regression analysis - Competing risk regression analysis

S-EPMC4190575	OmicsDI	The roots of plant defenses: integrative multivariate analyses uncover dynamic behaviors of gene and metabolic networks of roots elicited by leaf herbivory.	High-throughput analyses have frequently been used to characterize herbivory-induced reconfigurations in plant primary and secondary metabolism in above- and below-ground tissues, but the conclusions drawn from these analyses are often limited by the univariate methods used to analyze the data. Here we use our previously described multivariate time-series data analysis to evaluate leaf herbivory-elicited transcriptional and metabolic dynamics in the roots of Nicotiana attenuata. We observed large, but transient, systemic responses in the roots that contrasted with the pattern of co-linearity observed in the up- and downregulation of genes and metabolites across the entire time series in treated and systemic leaves. Using this newly developed approach for the analysis of whole-plant molecular responses in a time-course multivariate data set, we simultaneously analyzed stress responses in leaves and roots in response to the elicitation of a leaf. We found that transient systemic responses in roots resolved into two principal trends characterized by: (i) an inversion of root-specific semi-diurnal (12 h) transcript oscillations and (ii) transcriptional changes with major amplitude effects that translated into a distinct suite of root-specific secondary metabolites (e.g. alkaloids synthesized in the roots of N. attenuata). These findings underscore the importance of understanding tissue-specific stress responses in the correct day-night phase context and provide a holistic framework for the important role played by roots in above-ground stress responses.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- High-throughput analyses - Multivariate time-series data analysis - Transcriptomics - Metabolomics
S-EPMC5515270	OmicsDI	Real-time optotracing of curli and cellulose in live Salmonella biofilms using luminescent oligothiophenes.	Extracellular matrix (ECM) is the protein- and polysaccharide-rich backbone of bacterial biofilms that provides a defensive barrier in clinical, environmental and industrial settings. Understanding the dynamics of biofilm formation in native environments has been hindered by a lack of research tools. Here we report a method for simultaneous, real-time, in situ detection and differentiation of the Salmonella ECM components curli and cellulose, using non-toxic, luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs). These flexible conjugated polymers emit a conformation-dependent fluorescence spectrum, which we use to kinetically define extracellular appearance of curli fibres and cellulose polysaccharides during bacterial growth. The scope of this technique is demonstrated by defining biofilm morphotypes of Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium, and their isogenic mutants in liquid culture and on solid media, and by visualising the ECM components in native biofilms. Our reported use of LCOs across a number of platforms, including intracellular cellulose production in eukaryotic cells and in infected tissues, demonstrates the versatility of this optotracing technology, and its ability to redefine biofilm research.	gpt-3.5-turbo	1.

S-EPMC3426698	OmicsDI	Identification of soil bacteria susceptible to TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles.	Because soil is expected to be a major sink for engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) released to the environment, the effects of ENPs on soil processes and the organisms that carry them out should be understood. DNA-based fingerprinting analyses have shown that ENPs alter soil bacterial communities, but specific taxon changes remain unknown. We used bar-coded pyrosequencing to explore the responses of diverse bacterial taxa to two widely used ENPs, nano-TiO(2) and nano-ZnO, at various doses (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg g(-1) soil for TiO(2); 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg g(-1) soil for ZnO) in incubated soil microcosms. These ENPs significantly altered the bacterial communities in a dose-dependent manner, with some taxa increasing as a proportion of the community, but more taxa decreasing, indicating that effects mostly reduced diversity. Some of the declining taxa are known to be associated with nitrogen fixation (Rhizobiales, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and Bradyrhizobium) and methane oxidation (Methylobacteriaceae), while some positively impacted taxa are known to be associated with the decomposition of recalcitrant organic pollutants (Sphingomonadaceae) and biopolymers including protein (Streptomycetaceae and Streptomyces), indicating potential consequences to ecosystem-scale processes. The latter was suggested by a positive correlation between protease activity and the relative abundance of Streptomycetaceae (R = 0.49, P = 0.000) and Streptomyces (R = 0.47, P = 0.000). Our results demonstrate that some metal oxide nanoparticles could affect soil bacterial communities and associated processes through effects on susceptible, narrow-function bacterial taxa.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Bar-coded pyrosequencing  - DNA-based fingerprinting analysis  - Incubated soil microcosms

Changes in macrophage phenotype have been implicated in apoptotic cell-mediated immune modulation via induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?). In this study, we characterized PPAR? induction by apoptotic cell instillation over the course of bleomycin-induced lung injury in C57BL/6 mice. Next, the role of PPAR? activation in resolving lung inflammation and fibrosis was investigated. Our data demonstrate that apoptotic cell instillation after bleomycin results in immediate and prolonged enhancement of PPAR? mRNA and protein in alveolar macrophages and lung. Moreover, PPAR? activity and expression of its target molecules, including CD36, macrophage mannose receptor, and arginase 1, were persistently enhanced following apoptotic cell instillation. Coadministration of the PPAR? antagonist, GW9662, reversed the enhanced efferocytosis, and the reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression, neutrophil recruitment, myeloperoxidase activity, hydroxyproline contents, and fibrosis markers, including type 1 collagen ?2, fibronectin and ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA), in the lung by apoptotic cell instillation. In addition, inhibition of PPAR? activity reversed the expression of transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), interleukin (IL)-10, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). These findings indicate that one-time apoptotic cell instillation contributes to anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic responses via upregulation of PPAR? expression and subsequent activation, leading to regulation of efferocytosis and production of proresolving cytokines.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-?

Patients and Methods: Patients with pathologic evidence of clear cell RCC and radiographic evidence of metastasis were enrolled in this single arm phase II trial and were treated with SAbR in single or three treatments, followed by HD-IL-2. Correlative studies involved whole exome and transcriptome sequencing, T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, cytokine analysis, and mass cytometry on patient samples and correlated the results with clinical outcomes.  Results: Thirty mRCC patients were enrolled. A median of 2 (range 1-3) metastases were treated with SAbR. ORR of non-irradiated lesions was 16%; 8% showed complete response. Median overall survival (OS) was 16 months. All 30 patients developed treatment-related, reversible adverse events (AEs), including 22 (73%) grade ≥3 and no grade 5 AEs. Although SAbR did not improve the ORR to HD-IL-2, SAbR to lung metastases correlated with higher progression-free survival (p=0.0165). Correlative studies indicate increased frameshift mutational loads and mast cells with decreased circulating tumor-associated T-cell clones and T-cell clonal expansion in the group that benefited clinically. Patients with higher regulatory T-cell (Tregs)/CD8+ T-cell ratios in both baseline tumor and periphery did not benefit from this regimen.  Conclusions: Adding SAbR did not improve the response rate to HD-IL-2 in patients with mRCC. Tissue analyses suggest a possible correlation between frameshift mutation and tumor immune infiltrates, and clinical outcomes.  Patients were eligible if they were ≥18 years old, could give informed consent, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and showed pathologic evidence of clear cell RCC and radiographic evidence of metastatic disease with at least two lesions with a combined diameter of >1.5 cm that were amenable to SAbR (minimum gross target volume ≥2 cm3). Patients who had received prior oncologic treatments had to be >14 days from their most recent surgery, radiation, immunotherapy, or any targeted agent. Adequate cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and hematologic organ function were required. Patients were excluded if they had any form of immunosuppression. Patients with brain metastases were allowed if the metastases had all been adequately treated with surgery or radiation.  Clinigen Inc.

We hypothesized that such motifs might allow development of a novel approach to cancer detection. The motifs were cancer specific and achieved high classification accuracy: we found distinct motifs for breast versus colorectal cancer-associated repertoires, and the colorectal cancer motif achieved 93% accuracy, while the breast cancer motif achieved 94% accuracy. In the current study, we sought to determine whether such motifs exist for ovarian cancer, a cancer type for which detection methods are urgently needed. We made two significant advances over the prior work. First, the prior study used patient-matched TILs and healthy repertoires, collecting healthy tissue adjacent to the tumors. The current study collected TILs from patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and healthy ovary repertoires from cancer-free women undergoing hysterectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy for benign disease. Thus, the classification task is distinguishing women with cancer from women without cancer. Second, in the prior study, classification accuracy was measured by patient-hold-out cross-validation on the training data. In the current study, classification accuracy was additionally assessed on an independent cohort not used during model development to establish the generalizability of the motif to unseen data. Classification accuracy was 95% by patient-hold-out cross-validation on the training set and 80% when the model was applied to the blinded test set. The results on the blinded test set demonstrate a biophysicochemical TCR motif found overwhelmingly in women with HGSOC but rarely in women with healthy ovaries, strengthening the proposal that cancer detection approaches might benefit from incorporation of TCR motif-based biomarkers. Furthermore, these results call for studies on large cohorts to establish higher classification accuracies, as well as for studies in other cancer types.   	gpt-3.5-turbo	- T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing - Biophysicochemical motif analysis - Cancer detection classification - Patient-hold-out cross-validation - Independent cohort validation

In low Human Development Index settings, it ranks second. Screening and surveillance involve the cytology-based Papanicolaou (Pap) test and testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV). The Pap test has low sensitivity to detect precursor lesions, while a single hrHPV test cannot distinguish a persistent infection from one that the immune system will naturally clear. Furthermore, among women who are hrHPV-positive and progress to high-grade cervical lesions, testing cannot identify the ~20% who would progress to cancer if not treated. Thus, reliable detection and treatment of cancers and precancers requires routine screening followed by frequent surveillance among those with past abnormal or positive results. The consequence is overtreatment, with its associated risks and complications, in screened populations and an increased risk of cancer in under-screened populations. Methods to improve cervical cancer risk assessment, particularly assays to predict regression of precursor lesions or clearance of hrHPV infection, would benefit both populations. Here we show that women who have lower risk results on follow-up testing relative to index testing have evidence of enhanced T cell clonal expansion in the index cervical cytology sample compared to women who persist with higher risk results from index to follow-up. We further show that a machine learning classifier based on the index sample T cells predicts this transition to lower risk with 95% accuracy (19/20) by leave-one-out cross-validation. Using T cell receptor deep sequencing and machine learning, we identified a biophysicochemical motif in the complementarity-determining region 3 of T cell receptor β chains whose presence predicts this transition. While these results must still be tested on an independent cohort in a prospective study, they suggest that this approach could improve cervical cancer screening by helping distinguish women likely to spontaneously regress from those at elevated risk of progression to cancer. The advancement of such a strategy could reduce surveillance frequency and overtreatment in screened populations and improve the delivery of screening to under-screened populations.  We included samples from White Hispanic women age 18 years or older. We excluded women who were HIV+, pregnant, had an intrauterine device, or had a sexually transmitted disease at the time of sample collection. We obtained samples across all cytology result categories: Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy (NILM, Normal), Abnormal Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS), Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL), and High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL). At Parkland Health and Hospital System (PHHS), the primary screening strategy is cytology alone with a reflex hrHPV test for women with an ASCUS cytology result. The test assays for positivity across 14 HPV types, and the ASCUS result category is divided into ASCUS/HPV- (negative for all 14 types) and ASCUS/HPV+ (positive for at least one type). An additional exclusion criterion was applied to women with a result of Normal, ASCUS/HPV-, and ASCUS/HPV+, and that is they were excluded if they had previously had cervical cancer or previous treatment of cervical pre-cancerous lesions.  We applied these inclusion and exclusion criteria in a quota sampling scheme to ensure adequate representation of women across all five result categories. We targeted a minimum of 100 samples total with a minimum of 15 samples in each category, and then rescued all samples meeting our criteria each week until all minimums were reached.

Here, we present single-cell transcriptomic analysis of >100,000 viral antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from 40 COVID-19 patients. In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper cells and cytotoxic T helper (TH) cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2 and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (TREG). Importantly, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a strong cytotoxic TFH response was observed early in the illness, which correlated negatively with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Polyfunctional TH1 and TH17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells compared to influenza-reactive CD4+ T cells. Together, our analyses provide insights into the gene expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in distinct disease severities.

However, our knowledge on in vivo persistence of transfused Treg is limited. Whether Treg transfusion leads to notable changes in the overall Treg repertoire and or whether longevity of Treg in the periphery is restricted to certain clones is unknown. Here we use T cell receptor alpha chain sequencing (TCRα-NGS) to monitor changes in the repertoire of Treg upon polyclonal expansion and after subsequent adoptive transfer. We applied TCRα-NGS to samples from two patients with chronic GvHD who received comparable doses of stem cell donor derived expanded Treg. We found that in vitro polyclonal expansion led to notable repertoire changes in vitro and that Treg cell therapy considerably altered peripheral Treg repertoire toward that of the infused cell product, to different degrees in each patient. Clonal changes in the peripheral blood were transient and correlated well with the clinical parameters. We suggest that T cell clonotype analyses using TCR sequencing should be considered as a means to monitor longevity and fate of adoptively transferred T cells.    	gpt-3.5-turbo	- T cell receptor alpha chain sequencing (TCRα-NGS)

VDJ_PRJNA472381	VDJServer	Single-Cell Map of Diverse Immune Phenotypes in the Breast Tumor Microenvironment	Knowledge of immune cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment is essential for understanding mechanisms of cancer progression and immunotherapy response. We profiled 45,000 immune cells from eight breast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, and lymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumor tissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity. Our results support a model of continuous activation in T cells and do not comport with the macrophage polarization model in cancer. Our results have important implications for characterizing tumor-infiltrating immune cells.  Tissues were collected from women undergoing surgery for primary breast cancer.

VDJ_PRJNA248475	VDJServer	B cells populating the multiple sclerosis brain mature in the draining cervical lymph nodes	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by autoimmune-mediated demyelination and neurodegeneration. The CNS of patients with MS harbors expanded clones of antigen-experienced B cells that reside in distinct compartments including the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and parenchyma. It is not understood whether this immune infiltrate initiates its development in the CNS or in peripheral tissues. B cells in the CSF can exchange with those in peripheral blood, implying that CNS B cells may have access to lymphoid tissue that may be the specific compartment(s) in which CNS-resident B cells encounter antigen and experience affinity maturation. Paired tissues were used to determine whether the B cells that populate the CNS mature in the draining cervical lymph nodes (CLNs). High-throughput sequencing of the antibody repertoire demonstrated that clonally expanded B cells were present in both compartments. Founding members of clones were more often found in the draining CLNs. More mature clonal members derived from these founders were observed in the draining CLNs and also in the CNS, including lesions. These data provide new evidence that B cells traffic freely across the tissue barrier, with the majority of B cell maturation occurring outside of the CNS in the secondary lymphoid tissue. Our study may aid in further defining the mechanisms of immunomodulatory therapies that either deplete circulating B cells or affect the intrathecal B cell compartment by inhibiting lymphocyte transmigration into the CNS.    	gpt-3.5-turbo	High-throughput sequencing, antibody repertoire analysis

VDJ_PRJNA349143	VDJServer	Hierarchical Clustering Can Identify B Cell Clones With High Confidence in Ig Repertoire Sequencing Data	Adaptive immunity is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B cell clones. Each clone is the progeny of a single B cell responding to Ag, with diversified Ig receptors. These receptors can now be profiled on a large scale by next-generation sequencing. Such data provide a window into the microevolutionary dynamics that drive successful immune responses and the dysregulation that occurs with aging or disease. Clonal relationships are not directly measured, but they must be computationally inferred from these sequencing data. Although several hierarchical clustering-based methods have been proposed, they vary in distance and linkage methods and have not yet been rigorously compared. In this study, we use a combination of human experimental and simulated data to characterize the performance of hierarchical clustering-based methods for partitioning sequences into clones. We find that single linkage clustering has high performance, with specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value all >99%, whereas other linkages result in a significant loss of sensitivity. Surprisingly, distance metrics that incorporate the biases of somatic hypermutation do not outperform simple Hamming distance. Although errors were more likely in sequences with short junctions, using the entire dataset to choose a single distance threshold for clustering is near optimal. Our results suggest that hierarchical clustering using single linkage with Hamming distance identifies clones with high confidence and provides a fully automated method for clonal grouping. The performance estimates we develop provide important context to interpret clonal analysis of repertoire sequencing data and allow for rigorous testing of other clonal grouping algorithms.

ZENODO_4993459	Zenodo	Data from: The relative power of genome scans to detect local adaptation depends on sampling design and statistical method	Although genome scans have become a popular approach towards understanding the genetic basis of local adaptation, the field still does not have a firm grasp on how sampling design and demographic history affect the performance of genome scans on complex landscapes. To explore these issues, we compared 20 different sampling designs in equilibrium (i.e. island model and isolation by distance) and nonequilibrium (i.e. range expansion from one or two refugia) demographic histories in spatially heterogeneous environments. We simulated spatially complex landscapes, which allowed us to exploit local maxima and minima in the environment in 'pair' and 'transect' sampling strategies. We compared FST outlier and genetic–environment association (GEA) methods for each of two approaches that control for population structure: with a covariance matrix or with latent factors. We show that while the relative power of two methods in the same category (FST or GEA) depended largely on the number of individuals sampled, overall GEA tests had higher power in the island model and FST had higher power under isolation by distance. In the refugia models, however, these methods varied in their power to detect local adaptation at weakly selected loci. At weakly selected loci, paired sampling designs had equal or higher power than transect or random designs to detect local adaptation. Our results can inform sampling designs for studies of local adaptation and have important implications for the interpretation of genome scans based on landscape data.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Genome scans - Sampling design - Statistical methods - Equilibrium and nonequilibrium demographic histories - Island model - Isolation by distance - Range expansion from one or two refugia - Spatially complex landscapes - Local maxima and minima in the environment - Pair sampling strategy - Transect sampling strategy - FST outlier method - Genetic-environment association (GEA) method - Covariance matrix - Latent factors

ZENODO_7469919	Zenodo	Data from: 2-D sex images elicit mate copying in fruit flies	Although the environment is three-dimensional (3-D), humans are able to extract subtle information from two-dimensional (2-D) images, particularly in the domain of sex. However, whether animals with simpler nervous systems are capable of such information extraction remains to be demonstrated, as this ability would suggest a functional generalisation capacity. Here, we performed mate-copying experiments in Drosophila melanogaster using 2-D artificial stimuli. Mate copying occurs when naïve females observe the mating success of potential mates and use that social information to build their own mating preference. By replacing live demonstrations with (i) photos or (ii) simplified images of copulating pairs, we found that even crudely simplified images of sexual intercourse still elicit mate copying, suggesting that Drosophila is able to extract sex-related information even from a degraded image. This new method constitutes a powerful tool to further investigate mate copying in that species and sexual preferences in general.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Mate-copying experiments - 2-D artificial stimuli - Photos - Simplified images of copulating pairs
ZENODO_4768438	Zenodo	Memory extinction and spontaneous recovery shaping parasitoid foraging behavior	Animals can alter their foraging behavior through associative learning, where an encounter with an essential resource (e.g. food or a reproductive opportunity) is associated with nearby environmental cues (e.g. volatiles). This can subsequently improve the animal's foraging efficiency. However, when these associated cues are encountered again, the anticipated resource is not always present. Such an unrewarding experience, also called a memory-extinction experience, can change an animal's response to the associated cues. Although some studies are available on the mechanisms of this process, they rarely focus on cues and rewards that are relevant in an animal's natural habitat. In this study, we tested the effect of different types of ecologically relevant memory-extinction experiences on the conditioned plant volatile preferences of the parasitic wasp Cotesia glomerata that uses these cues to locate its caterpillar hosts. These extinction experiences consisted of contact with only host traces (frass and silk), contact with non-host traces or an oviposition in a non-host near host traces, on the conditioned plant species. Our results show that the lack of an oviposition, after contacting host traces, led to the temporary alteration of the conditioned plant volatile preference in C. glomerata, but this effect was plant species-specific. These results provide novel insights in how ecologically relevant memory-extinction experiences can fine-tune an animal's foraging behavior. This fine-tuning of learned behavior can be beneficial when the lack of finding a resource accurately predicts current, but not future foraging opportunities. Such continuous re-evaluation of obtained information helps animals to prevent maladaptive foraging behavior.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Associative learning - Memory extinction - Spontaneous recovery - Foraging behavior analysis - Conditioned plant volatile preference testing  - Ecologically relevant memory-extinction experiences analysis

ZENODO_4947813	Zenodo	Data from: Drivers of individual niche variation in coexisting species	1. Although neglected by classic niche theory, individual variation is now recognized as a prevalent phenomenon in nature with evolutionary and ecological relevance. Recent theory suggests that differences in individual variation across competitors can affect species coexistence and community patterns. However, the degree of individual variation is flexible across wild populations and we still know little about the ecological drivers of this variation across populations of single species and, especially, across coexisting species. 2. Here we aimed to (i) elucidate the major drivers of individual niche variation in natural communities and (ii) to determine how consistent this variation is across coexisting species and communities. 3. We analyzed natural patterns of individual-level niche variation in four species of coexisting generalist frogs across a wide range of tropical communities. Specifically, we used gut contents and stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) from frog species and their prey to quantify individual niche specialization. Then we combined data on local community structure, availability of prey, phylogenetic relationships, and predator-prey size models to test how this variation is related to four ecological factors which are predicted to be key drivers of individual specialization: intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, ecological opportunity (i.e., diversity of resources), and predation. 4. We found that the degree of individual trophic specialization varied by up to nine-fold across populations within the same species. This sizable variation in trophic specialization across populations was at least partially explained by gradients of density of competitors (both conspecifics and heterospecifics) and intraguild predation. However, the specific relationships between individual specialization and these ecological gradients were strongly species-specific. As consequences, the identity of the species with more individual variation changed among sites and there was typically no spatial correlation in the degree of individual specialization across co-existing species. 5. Our results show that individual niche specialization within and across species can be strongly context-dependent and that hierarchies of individual variation among coexisting species are not necessarily consistent across communities. Recent theory suggests that this pattern could lead to concurrent changes in competitive interactions across sites and thereby could play a key role in species coexistence at the landscape level. Our results suggest that individual variation across and within coexisting species has the potential to affect not only species coexistence at local communities, but also regional diversity patterns.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Gut contents analysis - Stable isotope analysis - Phylogenetic analysis - Predator-prey size models

ZENODO_4310163	Zenodo	Mating under climate change: impact of simulated heatwaves on the reproduction of model pollinators (Dataset)	 Climate change is related to an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events such as heatwaves. It is well established that such events may worsen the current worldwide biodiversity decline. In many organisms, heat stress is associated with direct physiological perturbations and could lead to a decrease of fitness. In contrast to endotherms, heat stress resistance has been poorly investigated in heterotherms; especially in insects, in which the internal physiological mechanisms available to regulate body temperature are almost negligible making them sensitive to extreme temperature variations. Wild bees are crucial pollinators for wild plants and crops. Among them, bumblebees are experiencing a strong decline across the world. Therefore, the ongoing global decline of these insect pollinators partly due to climate change could cause major economic issues. Here, we assess how simulated heatwaves impact fertility and attractiveness (key parameters of sustainability) of bumblebee males. We used three model species: Bombus terrestris, a widespread and warm-adapted species, B. magnus and B. jonellus, two declining and cold-adapted species. We highlight that heat shock (40°C) negatively affects sperm viability and sperm DNA integrity only in the two cold-adapted species. Heat shock can also impact the structure of cephalic labial glands and the production of pheromones only in the declining species. The specific disruption in key reproductive traits we identify following simulated heatwave conditions could provide one important mechanistic explanation for why some pollinators are in decline through climate change. 	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Simulated heatwaves - Fertility assessment - Attractiveness assessment - Sperm viability analysis - Sperm DNA integrity analysis - Cephalic labial glands analysis - Pheromone production analysis

ZENODO_5000201	Zenodo	Data from: Effects of arthropod inquilines on growth and reproductive effort among metacommunities of the purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea var. montana)	Many plant species harbor communities of symbionts that release nutrients used by their host plants. However, the importance of these nutrients to plant growth and reproductive effort is not well understood. Here, we evaluate the relationship between the communities that colonize pitcher plant phytotelmata and the pitcher plants' vegetative growth and flower production to better understand the symbiotic role played by phytotelma communities. We focus on the mountain variety purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea var. montana), which occurs in small and isolated populations in Western North Carolina. We found that greater symbiont community diversity is associated with higher flower production the following season. We then examined geographic variation in communities and found that smaller plant populations supported less diverse symbiont communities. We relate our observations to patterns of community diversity predicted by community ecology theory.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Field sampling - Taxonomic identification - Vegetative growth measurements - Flower production measurements - Community diversity analysis - Geographic variation analysis

ZENODO_7056381	Zenodo	Tidy' and 'messy' management alters natural enemy communities and pest control in urban agroecosystems	Agroecosystem management influences ecological interactions that underpin ecosystem services. In human-centered systems, people's values and preferences influence management decisions. For example, aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' agroecosystems may remove vegetation complexity with potential negative impacts on beneficial associated biodiversity and ecosystem function. This may produce trade-offs in aesthetic- versus production-based management for ecosystem service provision. Yet, it is unclear how such preferences influence the ecology of small-scale urban agroecosystems, where aesthetic preferences for 'tidiness' are prominent among some gardener demographics. We used urban community gardens as a model system to experimentally test how aesthetic preferences for a 'tidy garden' versus a 'messy garden' influence insect pests, natural enemies, and pest control services. We manipulated gardens by mimicking a popular 'tidy' management practice – woodchip mulching – on the one hand, and simulating 'messy' gardens by adding 'weedy' plants to pathways on the other hand. Then, we measured for differences in natural enemy biodiversity (abundance, richness, community composition), and sentinel pest removal as a result of the tidy/messy manipulation. In addition, we measured vegetation and ground cover features of the garden system as measures of practices already in place. The tidy/messy manipulation did not significantly alter natural enemy or herbivore abundance within garden plots. The manipulation did, however, produce different compositions of natural enemy communities before and after the manipulation. Furthermore, the manipulation did affect short term gains and losses in predation services: the messy manipulation immediately lowered aphid pest removal compared to the tidy manipulation, while mulch already present in the system lowered Lepidoptera egg removal. Aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' green spaces often dominate urban landscapes. Yet, in urban food production systems, such aesthetic values and management preferences may create a fundamental tension in the provision of ecosystem services that support sustainable urban agriculture. Though human preferences may be hard to change, we suggest that gardeners allow some 'messiness' in their garden plots as a "lazy gardener" approach may promote particular natural enemy assemblages and may have no downsides to natural predation services.	gpt-3.5-turbo	Experimental manipulation, biodiversity assessment, pest removal assessment, ground cover analysis

ZENODO_4990807	Zenodo	Data from: A low-cost solution for documenting distribution and abundance of endangered marine fauna and impacts from fisheries	Fisheries bycatch is a widespread and serious issue that leads to declines of many important and threatened marine species. However, documenting the distribution, abundance, population trends and threats to sparse populations of marine species is often beyond the capacity of developing countries because such work is complex, time consuming and often extremely expensive. We have developed a flexible tool to document spatial distribution and population trends for dugongs and other marine species in the form of an interview questionnaire supported by a structured data upload sheet and a comprehensive project manual. Recognising the effort invested in getting interviewers to remote locations, the questionnaire is comprehensive, but low cost. The questionnaire has already been deployed in 18 countries across the Indo-Pacific region. Project teams spent an average of USD 5,000 per country and obtained large data sets on dugong distribution, trends, catch and bycatch, and threat overlaps. Findings indicated that >50% of respondents had never seen dugongs and that 20% had seen a single dugong in their lifetimes despite living and fishing in areas of known or suspected dugong habitat, suggesting that dugongs occured in low numbers. Only 3% of respondents had seen mother and calf pairs, indicative of low reproductive output. Dugong hunting was still common in several countries. Gillnets and hook and line were the most common fishing gears, with the greatest mortality caused by gillnets. The questionnaire has also been used to study manatees in the Caribbean, coastal cetaceans along the eastern Gulf of Thailand and western Peninsular Malaysia, and river dolphins in Peru. This questionnaire is a powerful tool for studying distribution and relative abundance for marine species and fishery pressures, and determining potential conservation hotspot areas. We provide the questionnaire and supporting documents for open-access use by the scientific and conservation communities.	gpt-3.5-turbo	- Interview questionnaire - Structured data upload sheet - Project manual
