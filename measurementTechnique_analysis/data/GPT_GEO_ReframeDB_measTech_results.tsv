GSE57323	microRNA Expression Profile on Stimulated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from HIV-1 infected Elite Controllers, Viremic Patients, Treated Patients and Uninfected Donors	Background: The emerging relationship between microRNAs (miRNA) and viral-control is a topic of interest in the field of HIV. Host-genome might play an important role in the control of viremia. The aim of this study was to assess the specific miRNA profile that could contribute to the control of HIV replication in Elite ControllersResults: After adequate normalization, expression profile of 286 human miRNAs (hsa-miR) was evaluated in phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated PBMCs from 29 individuals classified in 4 groups: 8 elite controllers (EC; viral load <50 cp/ml without treatment), 8 viremic progressors (VP; VL>5000 cp/ml without treatment), 8 patients under antiretroviral treatment (ART; VL<200cp/ml) and 5 uninfected individuals (HIV-) through TaqMan® Array Human microRNA Cards v3.0.  A differential expression pattern consisting of 23 miRNAs overcame significantly different when comparing EC and VP. Profiling analysis segregated the population in two different blocks: while EC and HIV- clustered together in the same block (EC/HIV-_block 1), VP and ART individuals clustered together in a second block (VP/ART_block 2). Two inversely expressed miRNA patterns were determined within those two blocks: a set of 4 miRNAs (hsa-miR-221, -27a, -27b and -29b) was up-expressed in EC/HIV-_block and down-expressed in VP/ART_block while 19 miRNAs were down-expressed in block 1 and up-expressed in block 2. Differential miRNAs were successfully validated through individual RT-qPCR assays.Conclusions: Profile in EC resembled HIV- and differentially clusters with VP and ART. Therefore, differential clustering does not rely on undetectable viremia. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell were collected and processed from five uninfected controls, eight HIV-1-infected viremic patients, eight HIV-1-infected elite controllers with undetectable viral load without treatment and eight HIV-1-infected antiretroviral-treated individuals with undetectable viral load.	gpt-3.5-turbo	['RNA extraction', 'miRNA profiling using TaqMan® Array Human microRNA Cards v3.0', 'Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)', 'Data normalization']

GSE141878	Distinct epigenetic features of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells in colorectal cancer patients revealed by genome-wide DNA methylation analysis	Tumor-reactive CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) represent a subtype of T cells that could recognize and destroy tumor specifically. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells has important therapeutic implications. Yet the DNA methylation status of this T cell subtype has not been elucidated. In this study, we segregated tumor-reactive and bystander CD8+ TILs, as well as naïve and effector memory CD8+ T cell subtypes as controls from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, to compare their transcriptome and methylome characteristics. Transcriptome profiling confirmed previous conclusion that tumor-reactive TILs have an exhausted tissue-resident memory signature. Whole-genome methylation profiling identified a distinct methylome pattern of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells, with tumor-reactive markers (CD39 and CD103) being specifically demethylated. In addition, dynamic changes were observed during the transition of naïve T cells into tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells. Transcription factor (TF) binding motif enrichment analysis identified several immune-related TFs, including three exhaustion-related genes (NR4A1, BATF and EGR2) and VDR, that potentially play important regulatory role in tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells. Our study supports the involvement of DNA methylation in shaping tumor-reactive and bystander CD8+ TILs, and provides a valuable resource for the development of novel DNA methylation markers and future therapeutics. We used whole-genome methylome profiling and RNA-seq to investigate the characteristics of tumor-reactive and bystander CD8+ TILs, as well as naive and effector memory CD8+ T cell subsets as controls from colorectal cancer patients.

GSE55382	Allele-specific binding of ZFP57 in the regulation of imprinted and mono-allelic expression	Selective maintenance of genomic methylation imprints during pre-implantation development is required for parental origin-specific expression of imprinted genes. The Kruppel-like zinc finger protein ZFP57 acts as a factor necessary for maintaining the DNA methylation memory at multiple imprinting control regions (ICRs) in early mouse embryos and ES cells. Maternal-zygotic deletion of ZFP57 in mice presents a highly penetrant phenotype with no animals surviving to birth. In addition, several cases of human transient neonatal diabetes (TND) are associated with somatic mutations in ZFP57 coding sequence. Here we comprehensively map sequence-specific ZFP57 binding sites in an allele-specific manner using hybrid ES cell lines from reciprocal crosses between C57BL/6J and Cast/EiJ mice assigning allele specificity to approximately two thirds of all binding sites. While half of these are biallelic and include ERV targets, the rest show mono-allelic binding based either on parental-origin or on genetic background of the allele. Parental-origin allele-specific binding was methylation-dependent and mapped only to imprinted DMRs established in the germline (gDMRs). No binding was evident at secondary somatically-derived DMRs. ZFP57-bound gDMRs can predict imprinted gene expression and we identify new imprinted genes, including the Fkbp6 gene with a critical function in mouse male germ cell development. Genetic-background specific sequence differences also influence ZFP57 binding. We show that genetic variation that disrupts the consensus binding motif and its methylation is associated with mono-allelic expression of neighbouring genes. The work described here uncovers further roles for ZFP57 mediated regulation of genomic imprinting and identifies a novel mechanism for genetically determined mono-allelic gene expression. Input and Zfp57 CHiP-Seq profiles of hybrid Black6/Cast ES cells were generated by sequencing using the Illumina GAIIx platform.	gpt-3.5-turbo	['CHiP-Seq', 'Sequencing']
GSE202238	Alx function in the developing eye	Zebrafish with loss-of-function alx1 mutations develop with craniofacial and ocular defects of variable penetrance, likely due to compensatory upregulation in expression of a paralogous gene, alx3. We show that zebrafish alx1; alx3 mutants develop with highly penetrant cranial and ocular defects that resemble human ALX1-linked FND. alx1 and alx3 are expressed in anterior cranial neural crest (aCNC), which gives rise to the anterior neurocranium (ANC), anterior segment structures of the eye and vascular pericytes. Consistent with a functional requirement for alx genes in aCNC, alx1; alx3 mutants develop with nearly absent ANC and grossly aberrant hyaloid vasculature and ocular anterior segment, but normal retina. In vivo lineage labeling identified a requirement for alx1 and alx3 during aCNC migration, and transcriptomic analysis suggested oxidative stress response as a key target mechanism of this function. Oxidative stress is a hallmark of fetal alcohol toxicity, and we found increased penetrance of facial and ocular malformations in alx1 mutants exposed to ethanol, consistent with a protective role for alx1 against ethanol toxicity. Germline samples: RNAseq was performed on single zebrafish embryos  derived from an alx1;alx3/+ mutant incross.  A total of 12 samples (4 each of alx1, alx1; alx3/+ and alx1; alx3) were used  for pairwise comparisons; CRISPANTs samples: Additional samples were sequenced using 72hpf alx1; alx3 CRISPANTs (multiple alx3 guides injected into alx1 embryos).

GSE212104	Identification and interrogation of the gene regulatory network of CEBPA double mutant Acute Myeloid Leukaemia [Promoter capture HiC]	Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous haematological malignancy caused by mutations in genes encoding transcriptional and epigenetic regulators together with signalling genes. It is characterised by a disturbance of differentiation and abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. We have previously shown that each AML subtype establishes its own core gene regulatory network, consisting of transcription factors binding to their target genes and imposing a specific gene expression pattern that is required for AML maintenance. In the study presented here, we integrate gene expression, open chromatin and ChIP data, with promoter-capture HiC data to define a refined core gene regulatory network common to all patients with one CEBPA N-terminal mutation plus one C- terminal mutation that each disrupt the structure of a major regulator of myelopoiesis (CEBPAN/C AML). We identify the binding sites of mutated C/EBPα proteins in primary cells, we show that the C/EBP family, AP-1 factors and RUNX1 colocalise and are all required for AML maintenance, and we employ single cell experiments to link important network nodes to the specific differentiation trajectory from leukemic stem to blast cells. Taken together, our study provides an important resource which predicts the specific therapeutic vulnerabilities of this AML sub-type in human cells.

GSE77962	Adipose tissue gene expression is differentially regulated with different rates of weight loss in overweight and obese humans	Background: Moderate weight loss can ameliorate adverse health effects associated with obesity, reflected by an improved adipose tissue (AT) gene expression profile. However, the effect of rate of weight loss on the AT transcriptome is unknown.Objective: We investigated the global AT gene expression profile before and after two different rates of weight loss that resulted in similar total weight loss, and after a subsequent weight stabilization period.Design: In this randomized controlled trial, 25 male and 28 female individuals (BMI: 28-35 kg/m2) followed either a low-calorie diet (LCD; 1250 kcal/d) for 12 weeks or a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD; 500 kcal/d) for 5 weeks (weight loss (WL) period) and a subsequent weight stable (WS) period of four weeks. The WL period and WS period together is termed dietary intervention (DI) period. Abdominal subcutaneous AT biopsies were collected for microarray analysis, and gene expression changes were calculated for all three periods in the LCD group, VLCD group and between diets (ΔVLCD-ΔLCD).Results: Weight loss was similar between groups during the WL period (LCD: -8.1±0.5 kg, VLCD: -8.9±0.4 kg, difference p=0.25). Overall, more genes were significantly regulated and changes in gene expression were more extreme in the VLCD group compared to the LCD group. Gene sets related to mitochondrial function, adipogenesis and immunity/inflammation were more strongly upregulated on a VLCD compared to a LCD during the DI period (positive ΔVLCD-ΔLCD). Neuronal- and olfactory-related gene sets were decreased during the WL period and DI period in the VLCD group.Conclusions: The rate of weight loss (LCD vs. VLCD), with similar total weight loss, strongly regulates AT gene expression. Increased mitochondrial function and adipogenesis on a VLCD compared to a LCD reflect potential beneficial diet-induced changes in AT, while differential neuronal and olfactory regulation suggest functions of these genes beyond the current paradigm. In this randomized controlled trial, 53 male and female individuals (BMI: 28-35 kg/m2) underwent a dietary intervention (DI) with two different rates of weight loss consisting of either a low-calorie diet (1250 kcal/d) for 12 weeks or a very-low-calorie diet (500 kcal/d) for 5 weeks (weight loss (WL) period) and a subsequent weight stable (WS) period of four weeks. Abdominal subcutaneous AT biopsies were collected for whole-genome gene expression analysis at study start, after the WL period and after the WS period.This trial is registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov under the accession number NCT01559415.	gpt-3.5-turbo	['Whole-genome gene expression analysis', 'Microarray analysis']
GSE168192	Persister state-directed transitioning and vulnerability in melanoma	Melanoma is a highly plastic tumor characterized by dynamic interconversion of different cell identities depending on the biological context. For example, melanoma cells with high expression of the H3K4 demethylase KDM5B (JARID1B) rest in a slow-cycling, yet reversible persister state. Over time, KDM5Bhigh cells can promote rapid tumor repopulation with equilibrated KDM5B expression heterogeneity. The cellular identity of KDM5Bhigh persister cells has not been studied so far, missing an important cell state-directed treatment opportunity in melanoma. Here, we have established a doxycycline-titratable system for genetic induction of permanent intratumor expression of KDM5B and screened for chemical agents that phenocopy this effect. Transcriptional profiling and cell functional assays confirmed that the dihydropyridine phenoxyethyl 4-(2-fluorophenyl)-2,7,7-trimethyl-5-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexa-hydro-quinoline-3-carboxylate (termed Cpd1) supports high KDM5B expression and directs melanoma cells towards differentiation along the melanocytic lineage and to cell cycle-arrest. The high KDM5B state additionally prevents cell proliferation through negative regulation of cytokinetic abscission. Moreover, treatment with Cpd1 promoted the expression of the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase gene specifically sensitizing melanoma cells for the tyrosinase-processed antifolate prodrug 3-O-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-(-)-epicatechin (TMECG). In summary, our study provides proof-of-concept for a new dual hit strategy in melanoma, in which persister state-directed transitioning limits tumor growth and plasticity and primes melanoma cells towards lineage-specific elimination. RNAseq of melanoma cells with KDM5B knockdown (WM3734Tet3G-shJARID1B or as control  WM3734Tet3G-scramble, described in Shannan et al., European journal of cancer 2019) were induced with 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 72 h and analysed in triplicate using Illumina sequencer NextSeq 500.	gpt-3.5-turbo	['RNAseq', 'Doxycycline induction', 'Genetic knockdown', 'Cell functional assays', 'Transcriptional profiling', 'Illumina sequencing']
GSE45593	GENOMICS TO IDENTIFY HLA IDENTICAL RENAL TRANSPLANT TOLERANCE SIGNATURES	Immunosuppression is needed in HLA identical sibling renal transplantation.  We conducted a tolerance trial in this patient cohort using Alemtuzumab induction, donor hematopoietic stem cells, tacrolimus/mycophenolate immunosuppression converted to sirolimus, planning complete drug withdrawal by 24 months post-transplantation.  After an additional 12 months with no immunosuppression, normal biopsies and renal function, recipients were considered tolerant.  Twenty recipients were enrolled.  Of the first 10 (>36 months post-transplantation), 5 had immunosuppression successfully withdrawn for 16-36 months (tolerant), 2 had disease recurrence and 3 had subclinical rejection in protocol biopsies (non-tolerant). Microchimerism disappeared after 1 year, and CD4+CD25highCD127-FOXP3+ T cells and CD19+IgD/M+CD27- B cells increased to 5 years post-transplantation in both groups, whereas immune/inflammatory gene expression pathways in the peripheral blood and urine were differentially downregulated in tolerant compared to non-tolerant recipients. Therefore, in this HLA identical renal transplant tolerance trial, absent chimerism, Treg and Breg immunophenotypes were indistinguishable between tolerant and non-tolerant recipients, but global genomic changes indicating immunomodulation were observed only in tolerant recipients. A total of 46 PBMC samples representing blood draws from four time points in the first 9 recipients were processed for microarray analysis (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The analyzed time points were: immediately pre-operatively in the absence of immunosuppression (n=9); post-operatively at 1 year (n=8, range 11-13 months); at 2 years (n=12, range 18-25 months); >3 years (n=17, range 32-48 months).  (At year 2 and at > 3 years, repeated samples were obtained from individual subjects, and at one year, one subject had a technically unsatisfactory sample.)  To discount the effects of immunosuppression on gene expression, microarray data were included on whole blood from 18 healthy human subjects (controls: GSE40586; NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] repository).	gpt-3.5-turbo	['Genomics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Microarray analysis']

GSE39113	Control of Pro-Inflammatory Gene Programs by Regulated Trimethylation and Demethylation of Histone H4K20	Regulation of genes that initiate and amplify inflammatory programs of gene expression is achieved by signal-dependent exchange of co-regulator complexes that function to read, write and erase specific histone modifications linked to transcriptional activation or repression.  Here, we provide evidence for an unexpected role of trimethylated histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me3) as a repression checkpoint that restricts expression of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) target genes in macrophages. H4K20me3 is deposited at the promoters of a subset of these genes by the SMYD5 histone methyltransferase through its association with NCoR co-repressor complexes.  Signal-dependent erasure of H4K20me3 is required for effective gene activation and is achieved by NF-KB-dependent delivery of the histone demethylase PHF2.  Liver X receptors antagonize TLR4-dependent gene activation by maintaining NCoR/SMYD5-mediated repression. These findings reveal a histone H4K20 tri-methylation/de-methylation strategy that integrates positive and negative signaling inputs that control immunity and homeostasis. mRNA profiling from thioglycollate-elicited mouse macrophages treated with siRNA for Control, Smyd5 and Phf2 for 48 hours followed by 4 hours of LPS treatment.	gpt-3.5-turbo	['siRNA treatment', 'mRNA profiling']

GSE119163	Genome-wide characterization of the Fur regulatory network reveals a link between catechol degradation and bacillibactin metabolism in Bacillus subtilis	The goal of this study is to obtain a genomic view of the Fur regulatory network under both iron replete and iron deficient conditions in Bacillus subtilis using ChIP-seq. Besides the known Fur target sites, 70 putative DNA binding sites were identified, and the vast majority had higher occupancy under iron sufficient conditions. In addition,we discovered a role for catechol degradation in bacillibactin metabolism, and provided evidence that catechol 2,3-dioxygenase can detoxify endogenously produced catechol substrates in addition to its more widely studied role in biodegradation of environmental aromatic compounds and pollutants. To modulate intracellular iron levels, we employed a high-affinity Fe2+ exporter FrvA from L. monocytogenes to impose iron starvation. Bacillus wild-type cells (with C-terminal FLAG-tagged Fur at its native locus and an IPTG-inducible ectopic copy of frvA integrated at amyE locus) were harvested at 0 and 30 min after IPTG induction to study Fur-dependent regulation under iron sufficient and deficient conditions, respectively.	gpt-3.5-turbo	['ChIP-seq, genomic characterization, high-affinity Fe2+ exporter, immunoprecipitation, ectopic copy integration.']
GSE132843	Microarray data from human cultured ILC3s	Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident lymphocytes subdivided into ILC1s, ILC2s and ILC3s based on core regulatory programs and signature cytokines secreted. ILCs exhibit functional plasticity: for instance, human IL-22-producing ILC3s convert into IFN-γ-producing ILC1-like in vitro. Whether this conversion occurs in vivo is unclear. Using flow cytometry, mass cytometry and scRNAseq, here we found that ILC3s and ILC1s occupy opposite ends of a spectrum including discrete subsets in human tonsils. RNA velocity suggested strong directionality toward ILC1s for one ILC3-ILC1 intermediate cluster. Clonal analysis revealed graded ability of ILC3-ILC1 subsets to convert into ILC1-like cells. When examined in humanized mice, ILC3 acquisition of ILC1 features showed tissue-dependency. In chromatin studies, Aiolos emerged as a nuclear factor that cooperates with Tbet to repress evolutionarily conserved regulatory elements active in ILC3s. The human intestine also exhibited an ILC3–ILC1 transitional population. We conclude that conversion of ILC3s to ILC1-like occurs in vivo in human tissues, and that tissue factors and Aiolos are crucial for this process. ILC3 were sorted from human tonsils, expanded in SCF+IL-7 and stimulated with IL-23+IL-1b+IL-15 overnight.	gpt-3.5-turbo	['Flow cytometry', 'Mass cytometry', 'single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)', 'RNA velocity analysis', 'Clonal analysis', 'Chromatin studies']
GSE154493	p300 suppresses the transition of myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia [ChIP-seq II]	The p300 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) can function as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in hematologic malignancies. We have identified a tumor suppressor role for p300 in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) driven by Tet2 deficiency. Compared to Tet2-null hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), HSPCs lacking both p300 and Tet2 (double knock out, DKO) displayed enhanced proliferation and impaired differentiation. Consequently, p300Δ/Δ Tet2-/- mice developed acute myeloid leukemia. p300 loss in Tet2-/- HSPCs induced a global epigenomic reprogramming that enhanced leukemogenicity at least in part by increasing expression of Myb, as knock-down of Myb specifically hindered the proliferation of the DKO HSPCs. We show that p300 KAT activity regulates the function of Tet2 null HSPCs, and that augmenting p300 function impairs their unlimited self-renewal. Such a strategy could prove useful in individuals with Tet2 deficient hematopoiesis or MDS. 25M mouse lin- bone marrow cells were isolated from WT mice for Myb enrichment by ChIPseq.	gpt-3.5-turbo	['Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)', 'Knock-out (KO)', 'RNA interference (RNAi)', 'Enrichment']
GSE162842	The PAF1 complex promotes 3‘ processing of pervasive transcripts [ChIP-seq]	The PAF1 complex (PAF1C) functions in multiple transcriptional and co-transcriptional processes. Although many aspects of the requirement for PAF1 in coding gene transcription have been heavily studied, the function of PAF1C at sites of non-coding transcription is poorly understood.  eRNAs and PROMPTs are pervasive transcripts transcribed by RNA Polymerase II and rapidly degraded after 3’ endonucleolytic cleavage by the Integrator complex (Integrator). Here we show that PAF1C depletion results in near universal 3’ end processing defects in pervasive transcripts, leading to transcription termination dysregulation. Mechanistically, PAF1C recruits Integrator to chromatin through direct interactions promoting timely cleavage and transcription termination of pervasive transcripts. We also show that PAF1C recruits Integrator to the promoters of coding genes, where PAF1C then dissociates from the Integrator complex upon entry into processive elongation. Our results demonstrate an unexpected function for PAF1C in limiting the length and accumulation of pervasive transcripts, while highlighting a general requirement for PAF1C in Integrator recruitment.

GSE98006	Retinoic acid suppresses MYB in adenoid cystic carcinoma [ChIP-seq]	Translocations that drive overexpression of the oncogenic transcription factor MYB are molecular hallmarks of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), a malignant salivary gland tumor. Surgical resection, whenever possible, is the standard therapy for ACC, but there are no available therapeutic options available if surgery fails. Here we performed a chemical genetic screen using a zebrafish embryo culture system and identified retinoic acid agonists as potent suppressors of c-myb. Retinoic acid treatment strongly decreased c-myb gene expression in U937 cells and suggested a direct transcriptional mechanism of regulation. Retinoic acid agonists strongly inhibited tumor growth in vivo in different ACC patient derived xenograft models. Analysis of the xenografts revealed a significant decrease in MYB binding at translocated enhancers, thereby disrupting the MYB positive feedback loop that drives ACC. Our findings identify an important role of retinoic acid in MYB regulation and as a potential new effective therapy for ACC.

GSE51802	Association of CREB3L1 with promoters in LN4D6 CREB3L1 cells	The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in response to hypoxia-induced stress such as in the tumor microenvironment.  This study examined the role of CREB3L1 (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 1), a member of the UPR, in breast cancer development and metastasis.  Initial experiments identified the loss of CREB3L1 expression in metastatic breast cancer cell lines compared to low- or non-metastatic cell lines.  When metastatic cells were transfected with CREB3L1 they demonstrated reduced invasion and migration in vitro, as well as a significantly decreased ability to survive under non-adherent or hypoxic conditions.  Interestingly, in an in vivo rat mammary tumor model, CREB3L1 expressing cells not only failed to form metastases compared to CREB3L1 null cells but regression of the primary tumors was seen in 70% of the animals as a result of impaired angiogenesis.  Microarray and ChIP on Chip analyses identified changes in the expression of many genes involved in cancer development and metastasis, including a decrease in those involved in angiogenesis.  These data suggest that CREB3L1 plays an important role in suppressing tumorgenesis and loss of expression is required for the development of a metastatic phenotype.CREB3L1 is a member of the unfolded protein response family of proteins. CREB3L1 expression is lost from metastatic breast cancer cells. We wanted to determine the promoters of genes that CREB3L1 bound to.

GSE94302	Suppression of B-cell development genes is key to glucocorticoid efficacy in treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia	Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a central component of combination chemotherapy for childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). GCs work by activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand induced transcription factor, which in turn regulates genes that induce leukemic cell death.  Which GR-regulated genes are required for GC cytotoxicity, the pathways that affect their regulation, and how resistance arises are not well understood. Here we systematically integrate the transcriptional response of B-ALL to GCs with a next-generation shRNA screen to identify GC-regulated “effector” genes that contribute to cell death as well as genes that affect the sensitivity of B-ALL cells to dex. This analysis reveals a pervasive role for GCs in suppression of B-cell development genes that is linked to therapeutic response. Inhibition of PI3Kδ, a lynchpin in the pre-B-cell receptor and IL7R signaling pathways critical to B-cell development, with CAL-101 (idelalisib), interrupts a double-negative feedback loop, enhancing GC-regulated transcription to synergistically kill even highly resistant B-ALL with diverse genetic backgrounds. This work not only identifies numerous opportunities for enhanced lymphoid-specific combination chemotherapy that have the potential to overcome treatment resistance, but is also a valuable resource for understanding GC biology and the mechanistic details of GR-regulated transcription.Please note that the cell lines and primary samples were processed and normalized separately. The data submitted include the gene expression profiles for 11 cell lines and three primary patient samples.

GSE33163	HDAC3 requirement for the inflammatory gene expression program in macrophages [ChIP_Seq]	Pan-Hdac inhibitors (HDACi) are endowed with a potent anti-inflammatory activity, but the relative role of each of the eleven Hdac proteins sensitive to HDACi to the inflammatory gene expression program is unknown. Using an integrated genomic approach we found that Hdac3-deficient macrophages are unable to activate almost half of the inflammatory gene expression program when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A large part of the activation defect is due to loss of basal and LPS-inducible expression of IFNb, which in basal cells maintains Stat1 protein levels, and after stimulation acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner to promote a secondary wave of Stat1-dependent gene expression. We show that loss of Hdac3-mediated repression of nuclear receptors leads to hyperacetylation of thousands of genomic sites and associated gene derepression. The upregulation of the constitutively expressed prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase, Ptgs1 (Cox-1), has a causative role in the phenotype, since its chemical inhibition reverts the Ifnb activation defect. These data may have relevance for the use of selective Hdac inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents. Chromatin immuno-precipitations of H4 histone pan-acetylation followed by multiparallel sequencing performed in murine bone marrow-derive macrophages.

Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with CRX-I138fs mutation, we established an in vitro model of CRX-LCA in retinal organoids that exhibit defective photoreceptor maturation by histology and gene profiling including diminished expression of visual opsins. Gene therapy by delivery of an additional correct CRX allele using an AAV vector partially restored photoreceptor phenotype and expression of phototransduction-related genes as revealed by single cell RNA-sequencing. Retinal organoids derived from iPSCs of a second dominant CRX-LCA patient carrying a K88N mutation revealed loss of opsin expression as a common phenotype, which could also be alleviated by AAV-mediated overexpression of CRX. Our studies provide the proof-of-concept for development of gene therapy for dominant CRX-LCA and other CRX-retinopathies.

GSE86031	A distinct gene module uncouples dysfunction from activation in tumor-infiltrating T cells (batch 4)	Reversing the dysfunctional T cell state that arises in cancer and chronic viral infections is the focus of therapeutic interventions; however, current therapies are effective in only some patients and some tumor types. To gain a deeper molecular understanding of the dysfunctional T cell state, we analyzed population and single-cell RNA profiles of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and used genetic perturbations to identify a distinct gene module for T cell dysfunction that can be uncoupled from T cell activation. This distinct dysfunction module is downstream of intracellular metallothioneins that regulate zinc metabolism and can be identified at single-cell resolution. We further identify Gata-3, a zinc-finger transcription factor in the dysfunctional module, as a regulator of dysfunction, and use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to show that it drives a dysfunctional phenotype in CD8+ TILs. Our results open novel avenues for targeting dysfunctional T cell states, while leaving activation programs intact.

GSE145161	YY1 Control of Mitochondrial-Related Genes does not Account for Regulation of Immunoglobulin Class Switch Recombination	Immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) occurs in activated B cells with increased mitochondrial mass and membrane potential.  Transcription factor YY1 is critical for CSR and for formation of the DNA loops involved in this process.  We therefore sought to determine if YY1 knockout impacts mitochondrial gene expression and mitochondrial function in murine splenic B cells, providing a potential mechanism for regulating CSR.  We identified numerous genes in splenic B cells differentially regulated when cells are induced to undergo CSR.  YY1 conditional knockout caused differential expression of 1129 genes, with 59 being mitochondrial-related genes.  ChIP-seq analyses showed YY1 directly bound to nearly half of these mitochondrial-related genes.  Surprisingly, at the time when YY1 knockout dramatically reduces DNA loop formation and CSR, mitochondrial mass and membrane potential were not significantly impacted, nor was there a significant change in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, extracellular acidification rate, or mitochondrial complex I or IV activities. Our results indicate that YY1 regulates numerous mitochondrial-related genes in splenic B cells, but this does not account for the impact of YY1 on CSR, or long-distance DNA loop formation. Follicular B cells were isolated from the spleens of 3 C57Bl/6 yy1 fl/fl mice. For each spleen, 1/3 of the cells were not treated with any reagent (naive cells), 1/3 the cells received mock treatment (mock cells) and 1/3 received TATCRE (tatcre cells). The mock and tatcre samples were then grown in RPMI medium along with LPS+IL4 and 10% FBS for 72 hours. All cells were lysed and RNA was isolated for library preparation. Expression differences between Mock and TATCRE treated cells were determined to understand the role of yy1 in B cell activation.	gpt-3.5-turbo	['ChIP-seq analysis, RNA isolation, library preparation, gene expression analysis']

GSE57172	Transcript profiling reveals a molecular signature that distinguishes early versus late time to bud set phenotypes in a white spruce full-sib family.	It is crucial for north temperate tree species like white spruce to control timing of growth cessation and bud set in order to survive winter conditions.  While much work has examined both endogenous and exogenous mechanisms influencing this transition within angiosperms, the mechanisms underlying this transition in conifers; including photoperiod perception, growth cessation and development of endodormancy, have been less well-characterized. The objective of this research was to compare the genetic responses of spruce genotypes exhibiting an early transition from active growth to bud initiation with those that delay the transition, to tease apart the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex traits. In order to gain a deeper understanding of how genomic architecture influences bud phenology and related regulatory pathways, transcript levels were quantified using a 25,045 element spruce oligonucleotide microarray. Individuals exhibiting early versus late time to bud set were selected from a large unrelated full-sib family that had been phenotyped multiple years under natural and controlled environment conditions, and harvested at an early and mid stage of bud formation. Progeny designated as early time to bud set were more likely to undergo second flush, particularly under long day (16 h) and constant temperature (20°C) conditions. Approximately 5400 genes were differentially expressed in either or both of the early and late time to bud set phenotypic classes between time points, while ca. 1500 genes were differentially expressed between phenotypic classes at either or both time points. These analyses revealed about 400 genes with putative regulatory roles. The comparison between early and late time to bud set trees revealed a large number of specifically differentially expressed genes in the early developmental stage for bud formation (957 genes, including 53 putative regulators) relative to the later developmental stage (81 genes, including 4 putative regulators). Genes implicated in the circadian cycle, photoperiodic pathway and chromatin remodeling figured prominently in these lists, providing new insight into mechanisms that may regulate bud formation in determinate species such as white spruce. A clonally replicated QTL mapping population (cross C94-1-2516, ♀77111 × ♂2388), previously characterized by Pelgas et al. (2011), was used for this study.  Phenotypic data collected between 2006-2008 was used to identify extremes for time to bud set within the QTL population. Genotypes falling within the lower quartile for time to bud set for at least three of six experiments were designated as early time to bud set, while genotypes falling within the upper quartile for time to bud set for at least three of six experiments were designated as late time to bud set. Shoot tips from four ramets of each genotype were harvested for molecular analysis.  Two ramets were harvested at the first sign of bud formation (Time 1) and the remaining two ramets were harvested six weeks later at which time the majority of seedlings were at the mid stage of bud set (Time 2). Microarray hybridizations were conducted to make the following comparisons:  a comparison of bud development (Time 1 v. Time 2) in early time to bud set seedlings, a comparison of bud development (Time 1 v. Time 2) in late time to bud set seedlings, and a comparison of early and late time to bud set seedlings within early stages of bud formation or mid stage of bud formation. Each of two biological replicates for each time point and each phenotypic class was hybridized.	gpt-3.5-turbo	['Transcript profiling', 'Oligonucleotide microarray', 'QTL mapping', 'Phenotyping', 'Microarray hybridizations']
GSE151330	Functional assessment of the “two-hit” model for neurodevelopmental defects in Drosophila and X. laevis models of 16p12.1 deletion	We recently identified a deletion on chromosome 16p12.1 that is mostly inherited and associated with multiple neurodevelopmental phenotypes, where severely affected probands carried an excess of rare pathogenic variants in the genome compared to mildly affected carrier parents. We hypothesized that the 16p12.1 deletion sensitizes the genome for disease, but other hits in the genetic background modulate the ultimate phenotypic trajectory. To test this model, we examined the individual contribution of 16p12.1 homologs towards neurodevelopmental, cellular and molecular phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis. We observed that 16p12.1 homologs affect multiple phenotypic domains, leading to developmental delay, seizure susceptibility, brain size alterations, abnormal neuronal morphology, and cellular proliferation defects. In contrast to genes within CNVs of higher de novo occurrence, such as 16p11.2 deletion, homologs of 16p12.1 genes did not interact with each other, were less connected in a human brain network, and were sensitive to variation in the genetic background. Moreover, 214 “two-hit” models in the fly eye identified additive (47%), suppressive (34.5%), and epistatic (18.5%) interactions between 16p12.1 homologs and 80 homologs of genes carrying “second-hits” in children with the deletion and genes within related neurodevelopmental pathways. In fact, homologs of the intellectual disability-associated “second-hit” gene SETD5 synergistically interacted with homologs of MOSMO, modifying brain and cellular phenotypes and leading to new neuronal defects. Our results provide functional evidence for the “two-hit” model of neurodevelopmental disorders, where multiple 16p12.1 genes sensitize the genome to developmental defects, and complex domain-specific interactions with “second-hit” genes define the final phenotypic manifestation. mRNA-sequencing of Drosophila neuron-specific (Elav-GAL4 driver) RNAi knockdown (whole head) for four individual 16p12.1 homologs (CDR2, MOSMO, POLR3E, UQCRC2) and two VDRC GD wild-type controls (one with Dicer2 at 25°C, and one without Dicer2 at RT).

GSE193158	Transcriptomes of control and JAG1-deficient cochlea	The aim of this study is to identify the gene targets of the Notch ligand JAG1 in the postnatal cochlea. JAG1 was conditionally deleted in mice carrying both an inducible Cre allele (Sox2CreER) and a floxed (fl) Jag1 allele.  Tamoxifen was administered to P0/P1 pups.  Cochlear tissues from 6 Sox2CreER/+Jag1fl/fl and wildtype littermate controls were dissected under the dissecting microscope in ice-cold DEPC-treated PBS and stored in RNAlater (Invitrogen) at 4C. The RNAs were purified by RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN).  The quality and quantity of RNAs were measured by a 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent). Illumina compatible sequencing libraries were generated by the University of Rochester Genomics Research Center. Libraries were hybridized to the Illumina flow cell and single-end reads of 100nts were generated. Identification of significantly differentially expressed genes was determined using DeSeq2.  We found 548 differentially expressed genes with an adjusted p-value of <0.05, 411 of those genes were significantly upregulated while 137 were significantly downregulated.  Analysis of pathways revealed novel genes involved downstream of JAG1-Notch signaling in the postnatal cochlea. To delete Jag1 in maturing cochlear supporting cells, we administered tamoxifen to Sox2CreER/+Jag1fl/fl (Jag1-mutant) and Sox2+/+ (control) mice at postnatal day (P)0/P1.

GSE56068	Immortalization of T-cells is accompanied by gradual changes in CpG methylation resulting in a profile resembling a subset of T-cell leukemias [methylation]	We have previously described gene expression changes during spontaneous immortalization of T cells, thereby identifying cellular processes important for cell growth crisis escape and long term proliferation. Here we analyze the same model to investigate the role of genome-wide methylation in the immortalization process at different time points pre- and post- crisis using high-resolution arrays. We show that over time in culture there is an overall accumulation of methylation alterations, with  preferential increased methylation close to transcription start sites, island and shore regions.  Interestingly, the pattern of CpG site methylation observed in post-crisis T-cell cultures was similar to clinical T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples classified as CpG island methylator phenotype positive (CIMP+). These sites were highly overrepresented by polycomb target genes and involved in developmental, cell adhesion and cell signaling processes. The presence of nonrandom methylation events in in vitro immortalized T-cell cultures and diagnostic T-ALL samples indicates altered methylation of CpG sites with a possible role in malignant hematopoiesis.

ReframeDB_A00520	COVID-19 Nsp14 Guanine-N7-methyltransferase counterscreen assay	Secondary counterscreen assay for Nsp14 methyltransferase hits will utilize a commercially available bioluminescence-based biochemical assay (MTase-Glo, Promega). Purpose A commercially available bioluminescence-based biochemical assay kit (MTase-Glo, Promega) was utilized to measure methyltransferase activity for the ReFRAME primary screen. Nsp14 activity requires S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to act as the methyl donor, converting it to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) as it is consumed. At assay termination, a series of kit provided coupled reactions converts SAH to light: the SAH reaction product is converted to adenosine by SAH-hydrolase; then to AMP by adenosine kinase; then to ADP by polyphosphate:AMP phosphotransferase; then to ATP by pyruvate kinase. Finally, luciferase converts ATP to light, which is detected on a luminometer. These subsequent coupled reactions have the potential to be inhibited and picked up as false hits in the primary screen. Therefore, a counterscreen will be performed by omitting nsp14 from the reaction mix and replacing with SAH to simulate completed methyltransferase reaction conditions, and proceeding with the coupled reactions in the presence of drugs. Any inhibition observed would be indicative of off-target activity and/or false hits.  Protocol In 384 plates pre-loaded with test compounds, 1 ÂµM SAH in buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT is incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hr in the presence of MTase-GloTM reagent.

ReframeDB_A00350	hRSV High Throughput Screen	The high throughput cell-based HTS-system based on recombinant human respiratory syncytial virus type A GFP reporter virus (hRSV-A_GFP) identifies anti-hRSV compounds. HRSV is a major cause for acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised patients. Purpose hRSV is a globally distributed viral pathogen causing respiratory disease in humans. The high throughput cell-based HTS-system employs a recombinant hRSV-A strain encoding GFP fluorescent protein as reporter. Since the GFP gene is an integral part of the modified RSV genome, GFP fluorescence reflects efficiency of RSV infection and replication. A human epithelial cell line (HEp-2) is infected with hRSV-A_GFP viruses in presence of test compounds. Subsequently, GFP-fluorescence is quantified. The intensity of GFP fluorescence reflects RSV infection efficiency and is used as a marker to quantify antiviral efficacy of test compounds. In parallel, cell viability is examined by use of an MTT test. The MTT test examines metabolic activity of cultured cells. This information is used to distinguish between compounds with antiviral activity and cytotoxic molecules which destroy cells and therefore indirectly inhibit virus infection. Protocol HEp-2 cells are seeded in a clear bottom 384-well plates. Compounds are added together with the virus (MOI 0.5) 24h post seeding. Synagis, an antibody against the pre-fusion hRSV F-protein, is used as an inhibitory control and same volume of DMSO is used as the neutral control. Readout 48h p.i. supernatant is removed and PBS is added to the cells.

ReframeDB_A00398	Small Molecule Inducer of MDS Stem Cell Differentiation	Primary CD34+ stem cells isolated from bone marrow of MDS patient or MDS cell line will be used for this assay. GlyA will be used as a marker of erythrocyte lineage differentiation.    Purpose In MDS, some of the cells in the bone marrow are abnormal (dysplastic) and have problems making new blood cells. Many of the blood cells formed by these bone marrow cells are defective. Defective cells often die earlier than normal cells, and the body also destroys some abnormal blood cells, leaving the person without enough normal blood cells. Currently, the therapeutic treatment for MDS is limited to chemotherapy therapies or epigenetic modulators and response rate is fairly low. Due to the cause of MDS is primarily defect in cell differentiation, strategy that alters MDS stem cell differentiation potential with small molecule holds promise to treat MDS disease.   Protocol In screening with primary MDS cells, CD34+ selection from bone marrow biopsy of MDS patient will be performed to isolate MDS stem cell.  MDS stem cells will be cultured in expansion media for 4 days and switch to myeloid/erythroid differentiation media for another 3 days. Cells will be seeded at 2000 cells/well in 50 uL differentiation media and exposed to compound at 2 uM for 4 days. This is an imaging based assay, by the end of day 4, cells will be stained with anti GlyA antibody and scanned with cellomics. Increase in percentage of GlyA+ cells are expected with hit compounds. In screening to MDS cell line (similar to primary MDS cells), increase in GlyA+ cells are expected with hits. Different than with primary cells, this assay is a flow cytometry based assay and the cells will be seeded at 20,000 cells/well in 50 uL.

ReframeDB_A00343	Dengue Virus antivirals	Identification of chemical compounds inhibiting DENV-2 replication Purpose Antigen-antibody reactions are one of the most specific biological interactions. Antibody based detection of viral antigen represents one of the best ways to confirm viral infection. We use this method as a specific, scalable and quantifiable technique to measure viral infection. Cells (of choice) are treated with compounds at predetermined conditions (concentration, time, sequence) followed by challenge with the virus. After the predetermined time window, when sufficient viral protein is detectable, cells are fixed. Either fluorescently conjugated antibodies specific to viral protein/s or specific primary antibody followed by fluorescently labeled secondary antibody are used to detect viral antigen. Fluorescent DNA or cell membrane binding dyes are used to get an estimate of total cell numbers. Cells stained with these reagents are imaged on an automated microscope. Image analysis software is used to count the number of cells that are positive for viral antigen (a direct correlate of infection), level of fluorescence (bright or dim: another parameter indicative of the level of replication) and total cell numbers. Comparison of these parameters among treated and untreated groups gives the estimate of compound activity. If different doses for treatment of cells are used, dose response curves can be generated that enable estimation of IC-50s and IC-90s. Protocol In the primary screen, 2,250 Huh-7.5 cells resuspended in 40 µl of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS are plated in 384-well plates preliminary spotted with chemical compounds at a final concentration of 10 µM. 16 hours post seeding, 10 µl of diluted DENV-2 (MOI=5) are added to each well. 24 hours after the addition of the virus, cells are fixed by addition of 50 µl of 8% PFA to each well for 30 minutes. An immunofluorescence targeting DENV-2 envelope protein, followed by nuclei staining will be performed in order to quantify the percentage of infected cells. Briefly, cells will be permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X100. After blocking 30 min with PBS supplemented with 3% BSA, cells will be incubated 1h with primary antibody anti-DENV envelope mouse (1 µg/ml). After two washing steps with PBS, cells will be incubated another hour with anti-mouse Alexa488 secondary antibody (1/2500 dilution) and DAPI. After two additional washed with PBS, cells will be finally resuspended in 25 µl of PBS and plates will be sealed with aluminium foils. Readout Immunofluorescence (Alexa488 and DAPI staining) Detection Method the percentage of infection will be calculated as the ratio of denv-2-envelope stained cells over the total amount of cells in each well. data will be normalized to the median of the percentage of infection within each plate. zâ€™ for each plate will be calculated following the equation zâ€™ =1-[(3sc++3sc-)/(|âµc+-âµc-|)]; (c+:wells treated with dmso;  c-: wells treated with the dhodh inhibitor a3).  compounds reducing denv-2 percentage of infection of at least 50%, will be tested in ic50 and cc50 assays. prism will be used to calculate ic50 and cc50 values using a non-linear regression curve fit.

ReframeDB_A00252	Male Contraceptive Screen (Motility)	High-throughput screen for male contraceptive targeting sperm motility Purpose The Gates Foundation has identified the need for a male contraceptive. We have developed a dual readout phenotypic assay to screen for sperm function: 1) Multiple sperm motility parameters are measured using high-throughput live cell microscopy and cell tracking; 2) the status of the acrosome (a sperm specific Golgi-derived organelle) is measured using high-throughput flow cytometry.  The assays are in 384-well format and because they run sequentially which leads to a massive increase in throughput as compared to previous attempts in human sperm drug screening and allows for very efficient use of donor sample material. The assay is fully automated, flexible (screen for increased and decreased motility, acrosome agonists or antagonists) and extendible (e.g. for Ca2+ measurements). Furthermore, we have developed automated data analysis workflows to track sperm cells (motility assessment) and to gate sperm population (acrosome assessment).   Protocol Compounds are pre-spotted onto 384w black clear bottom microtiter plates (Perkin Elmer 6007550) at 6.25 uM for primary screen and 10uM top concentration for dose response. Human sperm from pooled donors is prepared, diluted, and dispensed 20uL into assay pre-spotted plates. Controls is added to columns 23/24. The plates are incubated for 10 minute at 37C and moved to CV7000 for fast imaging to look for sperm motility. The plates are then removed and stain and control are added for the acrosome reaction. The plates are incubated and moved to iQue screener for flow cytometry. Both data sets are processed using custom informatics solution.

ReframeDB_A00230	Identification of inhibitors of multiplication in cultured cells of the prototypic mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)	Identification of inhibitors targeting any of the steps of multiplication in cultured cells of the prototypic mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Purpose Several mammarenaviruses, chiefly Lassa virus (LASV) in West Africa, cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) disease in humans and pose a serious public health problem in their endemic regions. Thus, LASV infects several hundred thousand individuals yearly in West Africa resulting in a high number of Lassa fever (LF) cases associated with high morbidity and mortality. Notably, increased traveling to and from endemic regions has led to the importation of LF into non-endemic metropolitan areas around the globe. In addition, evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed prototypic mammarenavirus LCMV is a neglected important human pathogen of clinical significance. Moreover, because their stability, high morbidity and potential for aerosol transmission together with their unrestricted source from their natural rodent hosts, LASV and other HF mammarenaviruses pose a credible biodefense threat.  Concerns about mammarenavirus infections of humans are aggravated by the lack of US-FDA licensed vaccines and current anti-arenavirus therapy being restricted to ribavirin, which is only partially effective and associated with side effects. Therefore, there is an unmet need for the development of novel antiviral drugs to combat mammarenavirus infections. To this end, we have developed a robust cell-based assay to identify inhibitors of LCMV multiplication in cultured cells. The assay is based on the use of a recombinant LCMV expressing the ZsGreen reporter gene (rLCMV/ZsG). Levels of ZsGreen expression serve as surrogate of levels of virus multiplication. The assay has parameters compatible with HTS (S/B > 10, CV ‚â§ 10% and Z‚Äô > 0.5).  Primary hits will be subjected to secondary screens for confirmation and authentication and to rule out false positives. Validated hits will be used in dose-response assays to assess their potency (EC50) and toxicity (CC50), and hits with the highest selectivity index (SI, SI = CC50/EC50) and biological properties of interest will be advanced to studies using an already developed battery of cell-based assays to identify the steps of the virus life cycle being targeted by the hits uncovered by the screen, as well as to test their activity against LASV.  Protocol Compounds are pre-spotted onto Greiner 384w black clear bottom. Primary screen of the ReFrame library is conducted at a single dose of 10 ŒºM final concentration per compound. DMSO (0.001%) is used as vehicle negative control and Ribavirin (100 uM ¬µM final concentration), a validated inhibitor of LCMV multiplication, is used as a positive control. Vero cells (1x106 cells/well, M6 plate) are infected for 1h with rLCMV/ZsGreen at moi = 0.01. After 1 hour infection, a single cell suspension is prepared and seeded at 103 cells/ 384 well, 30 ¬µl/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 48 hour infection at 37 C, 5% CO2, 15 ul ¬µl of 12% PFA- PBS is added (4% PFA final concentration) and cells are fixed for 30 min, followed by removal of fixative, and 1x wash with PBS. Cells are stained with DAPI for 15 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with PBS. ZsGreen expression levels and DAPI staining levels are quantified using a fluorescent plate reader (Advanced Hybrid microplate reader Synergy H4) using the appropriate wavelengths to both excite and to measure emission of ZsGreen. Similarly, the appropriate wavelengths are selected for measurement of DAPI levels. Preliminary hits are identified based on low toxicity (cell biomass >60%, as determined by DAPI staining) and strong (>50%) inhibition of ZsGreen expression compared to vehicle-treated and infected cells. Primary hits are confirmed in the same assay format by a repeat experiment using three replicate wells per compound. Confirmed hits are tested in a dose-response assay and EC50 and CC50 values calculated (Prism using a non-linear regression curve fit). Readout ZsGreen expression levels are quantified using a fluorescent plate reader (Advanced Hybrid microplate reader Synergy H4), using the appropriate wavelengths to both excite and to measure emission of ZsGreen. Similarly, the appropriate wavelengths are selected for measurement of DAPI levels.   Percent inhibition of ZsGreen expression levels (as a measure of viral LCMV multiplication) is calculated by dividing the fluorescent level of the compound treated cells (test well) by the average fluorescent level (average of 8 wells) in DMSO treated wells, and values normalized to % multiplying by 100.  Values for ribavirin-treated control samples (8 wells) are calculated in the same way. DAPI levels are compared similarly to DMSO control levels as a measure of cell biomass. Levels of ZsGreen expression in ribavirin-treated control wells are consistently < 5% of those obtained in vehicle (DMSO)-treated control wells. Mock-infected cells have a consistent small background fluorescence that can be subtracted from both compound- treated and control wells before determining percentage inhibition. Detection Method quantification of zsgreen expression levels by determining fluorescence levels in wells containing pfa fixed cells. dapi staining as surrogate of biomass levels.

We identify the FLYC1 ion channels required for the touch response in Venus flytrap that are preferentially expressed in trigger hairs. In order to find agonist of the channel, we plan to use the Calibr ReFrame library (1200 compounds) for high throughput cellular fluorescent and luminescent screening assays. Using the FLIPR Tetra system, HEK cells expressing Yellow Fluorescent proteins whose bio-fluoresce is quenched upon the addition of anionic compounds, as well as the trans-membrane Ion Channel FlyC1, will be seeded with 20,000cells per well in 384 well plates. The fluoresce of the compounds will be recorded in live.  Protocol Using the FLIPR Tetra system, HEK cells expressing Yellow Fluorescent proteins whose bio-fluoresce is quenched upon addition of anionic compounds as well as the trans-membrane Ion Channel FlyC1 were seeded with 20,000 cells per well in 384 well plates. The fluoresce of the compounds were recorded in live time before and after the addition of the ReFrame library to record the change in fluorescent illumination upon the addition of the compound. Compounds are pre-spotted onto white 384 well microtiter plate. During FLIPR experiment, we add 20ul directly into the each well of cell plates that covered by 20ul of buffer.

ReframeDB_A00386	XDR Acinetobacter baumannii amikacin potentiation	Identification of potentiators of amikacin against XDR Acinetobacter baumannii via growth inhibition assay Purpose The goal of this screen is to identify compounds in the ReFRAME library that potentiate the efficacy of the aminoglycoside amikacin against extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii. Aminoglycosides such as amikacin are important therapeutic options for treating nosocomial Gram-negative infections, but resistant isolates are increasingly reported. Mechanistically, aminoglycosides have the dual advantage of inhibiting protein synthesis, thereby decreasing the expression of bacterial toxins and resistance-mediating enzymes, and permeabilizing the outer membrane. The 384-well screen identifies inhibitors of globally prevalent XDR A. baumannii strains, either through potentiation of amikacin and/or direct growth inhibition. This screen is performed following the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines, which recommends using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) reference methods for drug susceptibility testing (ISO 20776-1:2019). These guidelines were adapted to 384-well format to accommodate high-throughput screening and primary screening at single concentration. Protocol Compounds will be pre-spotted onto 384 well microtiter plate (columns 3-22) at 20 ÂµM for primary screen and 40 ÂµM top concentration for dose response together with a fixed subinhibitory concentration of amikacin corresponding to approximately 1/3 x MIC50 against the XDR A. baumannii strains. 5 x 105 CFU/mL of bacteria in Cation-Adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth (CAMHB) are then dispensed to wells in columns 1-24 to a final volume of 50 Î¼l per well. Control conditions are bacteria only with DMSO (negative control), bacteria plus amikacin at the selected combination screen concentration (to be determined) and bacteria plus positive drug control apramycin (at 4x MIC).

ReframeDB_A00213	Crypto-HCT-8 Host Cells (Wild C. parvum)	Cell-based assay which allows for concomitant measurement of Cryptosporidium parasite inhibition and host cell cytotoxicity using high-content imaging detection Purpose This is a secondary assay for hits active against C. parvum IOWA (Sterling and Bunch Grass Farm strains). Cryptosporidium parvum and the related species Cryptosporidium hominis cause diarrheal disease in humans. The current standard of care is ineffective in patients most at risk of cryptosporidiosis. This is a concomitant readout from the high-content imaging-based high-throughput screen of the full deck against the protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium parvum. HCI detection of this cell-based assay allows for concomitant measurement of Cryptosporidium parasite inhibition and host cell cytotoxicity. Protocol This specific ID is for HCT-8 host cells infected with field isolates of C. parvum, which were isolated from naturally infected calves at Washington State University by the Zambriski lab. For the assay, HCT-8 cells are seeded into 1536-well clear-bottom plates and incubated at 37C. 24 hours later, compounds are transferred (1.88 uM for primary screening and 25 uM top concentration for dose-response), and then excysted Cryptosporidium sporozoites and oocysts are dispensed onto cells. 48 hours later, cells are fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells are then washed, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with SuperBlock (Thermo), and finally stained with a 1:10 dilution of Superblock with 1ug/mL FITC-tagged Vicia Villosa lectin and 3uM DAPI nuclear stain. Cells are then washed with PBS-T to remove residual stain and plates are sealed with aluminum adhesive seals. Plates are imaged (10x objective) on the CX5 Cellomics imager using the SpotDetector algorithm.

ReframeDB_A00642	Inhibition of Bodipy-GTP binding to small g-protein CDC-42 in Multiplex	A microsphere-based screen that simultaneously interrogates GTP binding to a set of small G-proteins. Eight GST~G-proteins are coupled to bead sets of varying fluorescence intensity. Flow Cytometry is used to discriminate individual bead bound G-proteins and evaluate Bodipy-GTP binding. Purpose Small GTPases that include the Ras and Rho families regulate a wide range of cell signaling pathways by alternating between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states. In normal physiological conditions, their activities are tightly controlled and aberrant behavior related to an increased presence of GTP-bound forms contributes to tumorigenesis and other diseases. For this reason, the identification of small, cell-permeable molecules capable of modulating GTP-binding in a specific and reversible manner could prove therapeutically useful. This 384-well flow cytometric assay is capable of measuring Bodipy-GTP binding to nine small G-proteins simultaneously  (KRas WT, G13D, G12V, G12D, Q61H; Rac1 WT, CDC42 WT; Rab7 WT; RhoA). Chimeric GST~fusion proteins are bound to glutathione bead sets that are discriminated by differing intensities of red fluorescence of a fixed wavelength. Bodipy-GTP binding is detected using a separate green-wavelength channel. This format allows for the potential identification of selective modulators of GTP binding to particular G-proteins. Both increased and decreased fluorescence of bound Bodipy-GTP can be quantified.    Data listed in this assay shows specifically Kras-WT from the multiplex. Please view the following assays for the other g-binding proteins: Kras-WT (A00647), Kras-G13D (A00645), Kras-G12V (A00646), Kras-G12D (A00643), Kras-Q61H (A00641); Rac-1 WT (A00640), Rab-7 WT (A00639), and Rho-A (A00644) Protocol Bead sets (4ÂµM) that have been pre-coupled with GST~GTPase constructs overnight are washed to remove unbound proteins and are kept on ice until use. Assay plates with pre-spotted compounds (10ÂµM for the primary screen, 100ÂµM top concentration for the concentration-dependent analyses) and DMSO controls are assembled by adding 5ÂµL of assay buffer followed by 5ÂµL of the coupled bead set mixtures. The final concentration of each bead set is 200 beads/ÂµL. Compounds are incubated with GTPase~coupled beads for 30 minutes followed by the addition 100 nL of Bodipy-GTP to a final concentration of 10 nL followed by incubation for 1 hour. Assay plates are sampled using a high-throughput flow cytometry platform that delivers air-separated samples to a flow cytometer. Data from individual assay plates are acquired as single files that are subsequently parsed into individual bins with associated fluorescence signatures.    Readout Bodipy-GTP fluorescence associated with each individual bead set is measured after one hour of incubation.

Purpose The cell-based HTS-system based on a recombinant hRSV-A strain including a GFP reporter that reflects viral replication has been developed to identify anti-hRSV compounds. Total GFP signal is used as readout to determine, whether a compound reduces viral abundance. In parallel, a MTT (Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide) assay is conducted to distinguish between viral inhibitors and compounds reducing the GFP signal due to cytotoxicity. Thereby false positive results shall be excluded. When MTT is added to viable cells, the substrate is metabolized which leads to a measureable color change.

A. baumannii infections, such as nosocomial pneumonia and bacteremia, are a serious public concern, with drug resistant isolates a significant problem for treatment. Carbapenems, such as meropenem, are important therapeutic options for these infections, but resistant isolates have increasingly been reported. This is an assay to identify potentiators of meropenem antibiotic activity towards the carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii HUMC1 strain, an extensively drug-resistant (XDR), highly virulent clinical bloodstream isolate. HUMC1 has been well characterized in mouse models of infection by the Spellberg lab (USC), facilitating follow up of screen hits in vivo. This screen is carried out in defined cell culture medium, mimicking in vivo growth conditions of the bacteria during infection. Protocol Compounds are acoustically transferred via Echo into 1536-well white plates (20 uM for primary screen and 40 uM top concentration for dose-response, with 10 uM of meropenem throughout).

ReframeDB_A00442	Identification of Small Molecules that Eradicate Breast Cancer Stem Cells	The goal of this project is to identify small molecules that eradicate breast cancer stem cells using a high-throughput, fluorescence imaging-based mammosphere formation assay.  Purpose Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are a subpopulation of cells within a breast tumor that drive tumor initiation, progression and recurrence. BCSCs are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, and therefore persist after treatment. Thus, to cure breast cancer, eradication of BCSCs is required. To screen for compounds that eradicate BCSCs, we have developed an automated, high-throughput, fluorescence imaging-based version of the mammosphere formation assay, a well-established method for quantifying BCSCs in cell lines and tumors. In brief, human breast cancer MCF7 cells are plated at conditions in which BCSCsâ€”but not non-BCSCs present in the cell populationâ€”are able to survive and form mammospheres, which are three-dimensional spheroids that can be detected by imaging. Compounds that prevent mammosphere formation typically also induce cell death, resulting in aggregation of dead cells in the bottom of the well. Cells are therefore stained with Hoechst 33342 (a blue fluorescent dye that stains chromatin) and propidium iodide (PI, a red fluorescent dye that stains dead cells), and the gate is adjusted to distinguish intact mammospheres (which are blue) from aggregates of dead cells (which are red/purple). Protocol MCF7 cells (in DME/F12 medium plus supplements) are added to each well at low density (150 cells/well) and 5 days later cells are stained with Hoechst (20 nM) and PI (50 Âµg/mL).  Readout Plates are imaged using the Celigo Imaging Cytometer system with the gate adjusted to distinguish intact mammospheres (which are permeable to Hoechst and are thus primarily blue with little to no detectable signal in the red channel) from aggregates of dead cells (which are permeable to both dyes and are thus primarily red/purple). We have designed the read out from the Celigo as a binary output of either normal mammosphere formation (equivalent to that of the DMSO control) as â€œ1â€ (blue) or reduced mammosphere formation as â€œ0â€ (red/purple). Detection Method the detection method is fluorescence. Detection Reagents The reagents used for detection are two fluorescent dyes, Hoechst 33342 (blue) and PI (red). Components MCF7 cells, serum-free medium (DME/F12) and supplements (EGF (20 ng/mL), bFGF (20 ng/mL), B27, Pen/Strep), Hoechst 33342 and PI.

ReframeDB_A00462	SARS-CoV2/VeroE6-EGFP HTS antiviral assay	Screening assay for antiviral agents against SARS-CoV2, using EGFP reporter VeroE6 cells.  Purpose A virus-cell-based phenotypic assay with COVID-19 in a reporter cell-line (fluoresencent EGPF VeroE6 cells) will be used to assess the antiviral activity of a library of compounds. Because COVID-19 induces cell death, the detection of fluorescence of these cells after the incubation period implies they have not been killed by the virus nor succumbed due to toxicity of the compound, which is indicative of a selective antiviral inhibitor. The phenotypic assay will be performed in the fully automated Caps-It isolator system (https://rega.kuleuven.be/cmt/capsit) of the Rega Institute, KU LEUVEN. This research infrastructure has been designed to perform high-throughput phenotypic assays with viable pathogens without risking exposure of the environment or the operators around the system. After import of plates containing the pre-plated compounds and cells that have been added at the start of assay, the robot system infects the cells by adding the virus and, after incubation in the system for an appropriate period, data are automatically collected by means of fluorescence readout and microscopy. The images are processed by the software in which the high-content imaging instruments are embedded, followed by analysis in the Screener (Genedata) warehouse software platform, allowing for quickly identifying hits for further study Protocol A similar protocol as in Ivens, T. et al. J. Virological Methods 2005, 129, 56-63 is followed.   VeroE6-EGFP are provided by Janssen as "VeroE6-EGFP Cl-21 #2 02-sep-2003". Cells are propagated in "DMEM10%" which is prepared by supplementing DMEM (gibco cat no 41965-039) with 10% v/v heat-inactivated FCS (Biowest S1810-500 lot S17193S1810) and 5 mL sodium bicarbonate 7.5% (Gibco 25080-060). Cells are split 1/4 twice a week. Pen-strep is added directly to the cell culture bottle during culture, but is not added during the antiviral assay.  For antiviral testing cells are detached using trypsine. For this the confluent cell monolayer in a T150 flask is first washed with DPBS, 10 mL trypsine 0.25%trypsine/EDTA is added and incubated for 1 minute. Then all trypsine is removed except for 2 mL and the cells are incubated 15 minutes at 37Â°C. The cells are then resuspended in 20 mL assay medium (DMEM 2% v/v FCS and sodium bicarbonate as above) and passed through a cell restrainer (FALCON cat no 352350). Cells are counted and diluted in assay medium to 2000 cells / 30 ÂµL. Using a multidrop C23-24 of the 384-well assay ready plates are filled with 30 ÂµL assays medium. Next 30 ÂµL of the cell suspension is added to C1-24. Plates are subsequently transferred to the Caps-It platform where 30 ÂµL of virus inoculum is added to C1-22 after which they are placed in a cell culture incubator (37Â°C, 5%CO2). On day 5 the plates analyzed by whole-well fluorescence and/or by high-content imaging. The titer of the virus inoculum is optimized in previous experiments.

ReframeDB_A00507	Development of preclinical candidates for the treatment of NTM disease	In vitro high-throughput phenotypic screen to identify small molecule inhibitors with activity against both Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium species, ideally also active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Purpose This is an in vitro high-throughput phenotypic screen to identify new orally bioavailable preclinical development candidate compounds for the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease caused by both Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium species. NTM are diverse and ubiquitous in the environment and are increasingly being identified globally in association with serious, usually opportunistic, infections in humans. M. abscessus, one of the most commonly identified NTM species responsible for severe respiratory, skin and mucosal infections in humans, is intrinsically resistant to available antibiotics, underscoring the need to identify novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NTM lung disease. Protocol Mid-log (OD600 = 0.4-0.6) cultures of M. abscessus Bamboo and M. avium 11 grown in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium are diluted to OD600 = 0.05 prior to incubation in the presence of the compounds at 37Â°C with shaking at 110 rpm for 3 and 4 days, respectively. Following incubation, percentage growth inhibition is calculated by normalization to Day 0 data and DMSO negative controls as reference. Compounds displaying >85% growth inhibition against both M. abscessus Bamboo and M. avium 11 species are followed up in secondary dose-response screens to identify those with the most potent activity against both organisms. Following selection of the most promising candidate compounds, carried out in consultation with Calibr, further in vitro and in vivo characterization is carried out to facilitate target deconvolution and to determine efficacy in the mouse model of NTM infection.  Readout Read out will measure cell growth as a function of absorbance at OD600; data are normalized to the DMSO carrier in the absence of compound. Detection Method absorbance measured at od600; clarithromycin is used as a positive control; dmso is the negative control, used for normalization of bacterial cell growth.

ReframeDB_A00095	M. tuberculosis growth inhibition	Inhibition of M. tuberculosis proliferation in standard 7H9 medium supplemented with oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase, tyloxapol, and glycerol Purpose Mycobacterium tuberculosis represents an immense global public health problem, which has been exacerbated by the emergence of strains resistant to multiple antibiotics. This assay seeks to identify novel small molecules that restrict the growth of M. tuberculosis. This assay is specific to the Mtb strain H37Ra grown in standard Middlebrook 7H9 medium (no host cells) supplemented with OADC. Protocol Compounds are dry spotted into white 1536-well microtiter plates at 10uM screening concentration for primary screening at 20uM top concentration for dose-response reconfirmation. For the assay, 6uL of diluted H37Ra bacteria at a final OD600 of 0.025 is dispensed into pre-spotted assay plates. Cultures are allowed to grow for 72h at 37C. After incubation, viability is determined by measuring ATP content. 2 uL of BacTiter-Glo is added to wells and incubated 5 minutes. Luminescence is read on Perkin Elmer Viewlux.

ReframeDB_A00272	Measuring cell sickling times to screen for drugs that treat sickle cell disease by inhibiting hemoglobin S polymerization.	A sensitive kinetic assay is being used to screen for compounds that can be drugs for treating sickle cell disease.  The assay measures the sickling time distribution of red cells from sickle cell trait, the heterozygous condition. Purpose The root cause of the pathology of sickle cell disease is the polymerization of the mutant hemoglobin S upon deoxygenation in the tissues to form fibers that distort ("sickle") and stiffen red cells.  The less flexible cells may not pass through the narrowest vessels of the tissues, thereby causing vaso-occlusion, which results in chronic organ damage and intermittent episodes of pain so severe that they are called "sickle cell crises". There are six distinct mechanisms to inhibit sickling with anti-polymerization drugs for treating the disease (outlined in detail in WA Eaton and HF Bunn, Blood, 129: 2719-2726, 2017). Our assay screens for all but fetal hemoglobin induction, but will be key for monitoring the sickling of blood from patients in clinical trials taking drugs that inhibit polymerization by inducing fetal hemoglobin or by any of the other five mechanisms. By far the most sensitive assay for testing the inhibitory effect of potential drugs is to measure its effect on the sickling time, which is the delay time prior to fiber formation in intact red cells. The assay is also the most patho-physiologically relevant, since increasing the delay time allows more cells to escape the narrow vessels of the tissues before fibers form, thereby lowering the probability of vaso-occlusion. Protocol Blood from donors with sickle cell trait, the heterozygous condition, is diluted 3000-fold into a physiological buffer at pH 7.35 consisting of 20 mM phosphate, 134 mM NaCl, 1 g/L dextrose. 10 microliters of this red cell suspension is added to each well of the 384 well plate. 252 wells are spotted with 100 picomoles of compounds from the reFRAME library. Of the remaining 132 wells, 32 (columns 3 and 22) contain only the red cell suspension and serve as neutral (negative) controls, while 32 (columns 2 and 23) contain a red cell suspension in a buffer of 180 millimolar and serve as inhibitor (positive) controls, since the increase in volume at the decreased osmolarity dilutes the intracellular hemoglobin sufficiently to prevent sickling. The 68 wells that line the edge of the plate contain controls, but are not considered in the analysis because of possible edge effects. The plate is inserted into a humidified thermostated chamber in air of the Biotek â€œLionheartâ€ microscope system for two hours at 37 C followed by deoxygenation with 100% nitrogen for up to 12 hours at 37 C, with images collected every 15 minutes (the time required to collect an image from all 384 wells). Compounds that increase the sickling times to an extent that is therapeutic will be selected for studies of the concentration dependence on sickle trait cells to determine the lowest concentration at which they have therapeutic potential. For compounds that are known to be non-toxic at the concentration predicted to be therapeutic, sickling time measurements will be performed using the same assay on cells from patients with homozygous sickle cell disease, but with 5% oxygen to slow sickling. Readout A compound will be labeled a "hit" if it results in a percent sickled relative to neutral control (with 70-80% sickled, the maximum of the Z-factor) of 50% or less. This is the upper limit of the percent sickled expected for trait cells in which 50% of the total hemoglobin in trait cells has been replaced by hemoglobin C, mimicking SC disease, which is known to be a milder form of sickle cell disease (explained in detail in Li et al, PNAS 2017). Detection Method the image of 100-200 cells in each well on a ccd camera is collected every 15 minutes, the time required to collect an image from all 384 wells during deoxygenation. sickling times are determined by monitoring several metrics of the cell image to determine during which 15-minute interval the cell has sickled. this analysis is accomplished using our in-house developed, robust image analysis software (described in detail in li et al., pnas 114: e689-e696, 2017). these metrics include the eccentricity (deviation from the circular projection of the unsickled biconcave disc shape), the ratio of the optical density at the periphery of the cell to that at the cell center (unsickled cells are more transparent in the center), and the projected area of the cell (sickled cells have a smaller projection than unsickled cells).

ReframeDB_A00489	SARS-CoV2 Entry Inhibitor	Identification of SARS-CoV2 spike mediated inhibitors by luminescence assay. Purpose Entry of coronaviruses requires the sequential functions of two subunits of spike protein (S), S1 and S2 on the viral surface. S1 subunit or more precisely a smaller domain in this region called receptor binding domain (RBD) is primarily responsible for binding to functional receptors on target cells. S2 subunit facilitates the fusion of cell membrane with viral membrane, and its efficiency is determined by priming steps by cellular proteases as well as following conformational change. SARS2-CoV, the same as SARS-CoV, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for entry. Cleavage of S2’ site in S2 subunit by a serine protease named TMPRSS2 demonstrated a priming function and leads to a more efficient entry mediated by SARS2-CoV S. Therefore, inhibitors that either block the interaction of S1 or RBD with cellular receptors or the fusion mediated by S2 domain could inhibit entry of the virus. This 1536 well assay will identify inhibitors of the S-mediated entry by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based reporter delivered by a pseudotyped viral system. The luminescence signal is dependent on entry efficiency mediated by S, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate inhibition.  Protocol Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  HEK293 ACE2 expressing cells will be seeded at 2000 cells in 2.5uL of media into each well containing compounds and controls. After 1 hour incubation the pseudo virus particles will be seeded at 2.5uL/well in complete media. After 48 hour incubation, 5 uL of One Glo Firefly luciferase substrate will be added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes before luminescence reading on Perkin ViewLux.  Readout One Glo (Promega) substrate will be used to measure Firefly luciferase luminescence. Activity of the reporter will be measured by Firefly luciferase reporter output. Values will be normalized based on Fluc signal from cells plus media plus DMSO (positive) vs. cells plus MLV-SARS2-S Fmut virus infection +DMSO (negative).

ReframeDB_A00640	Inhibition of Bodipy-GTP binding to small g-protein Rac-1 from Multiplex	A microsphere-based screen that simultaneously interrogates GTP binding to a set of small G-proteins. Eight GST~G-proteins are coupled to bead sets of varying fluorescence intensity. Flow Cytometry is used to discriminate individual bead bound G-proteins and evaluate Bodipy-GTP binding. Purpose Small GTPases that include the Ras and Rho families regulate a wide range of cell signaling pathways by alternating between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states. In normal physiological conditions, their activities are tightly controlled and aberrant behavior related to an increased presence of GTP-bound forms contributes to tumorigenesis and other diseases. For this reason, the identification of small, cell-permeable molecules capable of modulating GTP-binding in a specific and reversible manner could prove therapeutically useful. This 384-well flow cytometric assay is capable of measuring Bodipy-GTP binding to nine small G-proteins simultaneously  (KRas WT, G13D, G12V, G12D, Q61H; Rac1 WT, CDC42 WT; Rab7 WT; RhoA). Chimeric GST~fusion proteins are bound to glutathione bead sets that are discriminated by differing intensities of red fluorescence of a fixed wavelength. Bodipy-GTP binding is detected using a separate green-wavelength channel. This format allows for the potential identification of selective modulators of GTP binding to particular G-proteins. Both increased and decreased fluorescence of bound Bodipy-GTP can be quantified.    Data listed in this assay shows specifically Kras-WT from the multiplex. Please view the following assays for the other g-binding proteins: Kras-WT (A00647), Kras-G13D (A00645), Kras-G12V (A00646), Kras-G12D (A00643), Kras-Q61H (A00641), CDC-42 WT (A00642), Rab-7 WT (A00639), and Rho-A (A00644) Protocol Bead sets (4ÂµM) that have been pre-coupled with GST~GTPase constructs overnight are washed to remove unbound proteins and are kept on ice until use. Assay plates with pre-spotted compounds (10ÂµM for the primary screen, 100ÂµM top concentration for the concentration-dependent analyses) and DMSO controls are assembled by adding 5ÂµL of assay buffer followed by 5ÂµL of the coupled bead set mixtures. The final concentration of each bead set is 200 beads/ÂµL. Compounds are incubated with GTPase~coupled beads for 30 minutes followed by the addition 100 nL of Bodipy-GTP to a final concentration of 10 nL followed by incubation for 1 hour. Assay plates are sampled using a high-throughput flow cytometry platform that delivers air-separated samples to a flow cytometer. Data from individual assay plates are acquired as single files that are subsequently parsed into individual bins with associated fluorescence signatures.    Readout Bodipy-GTP fluorescence associated with each individual bead set is measured after one hour of incubation. Positive and negative control wells are used to calculate Zâ€™ statistics and active hit compounds are selected based on % signal deviation from control well averages.

Carbapenems, such as meropenem, are important therapeutic options for these infections, but resistant isolates have increasingly been reported. This is an assay to identify potentiators of meropenem antibiotic activity towards the carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii HUMC1 strain, an extensively drug-resistant (XDR), highly virulent clinical bloodstream isolate. HUMC1 has been well characterized in mouse models of infection by the Sternberg lab (USC), facilitating follow up of screen hits in vivo. This screen is carried out in defined cell culture medium, mimicking in vivo growth conditions of the bacteria during infection. Protocol Compounds are acoustically transferred via Echo into 1536-well white plates (20 uM for primary screen and 40 uM top concentration for dose-response, with 10 uM of meropenem throughout). Overnight cultures of bacteria are subcultured, diluted in assay media (a defined cell culture medium with high concentration of normal mouse serum), and dispensed into plates.

Purpose Cryptosporidium parvum and the related species Cryptosporidium hominis cause diarrheal disease in humans. The current standard of care is ineffective in patients most at risk of cryptosporidiosis. This is a concomitant readout from the high-content imaging-based high-throughput screen of the full deck against the protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium parvum (A00093). HCI detection of this cell-based assay allows for concomitant measurement of Cryptosporidium parasite inhibition and host cell cytotoxicity. Protocol This specific ID is for HCT-8 host cells infected with the Sterling Parasitology Lab strain of C. parvum (IOWA), which has been routinely passaged through neonatal calves to propagate. For the assay, HCT-8 cells are seeded into 1536-well clear-bottom plates and incubated at 37C. 24 hours later, compounds are transferred (1.88 uM for primary screening and 25 uM top concentration for dose-response), and then excysted Cryptosporidium sporozoites and oocysts are dispensed onto cells. 48 hours later, cells are fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells are then washed, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with SuperBlock (Thermo), and finally stained with a 1:10 dilution of Superblock with 1ug/mL FITC-tagged Vicia Villosa lectin and 3uM DAPI nuclear stain. Cells are then washed with PBS-T to remove residual stain and plates are sealed with aluminum adhesive seals.

ReframeDB_A00198	TB Deconstructed Granuloma	Screening of ReFRAME library +/- isoniazid (INH) for synergistic activity against tetracycline-inducible mKO fluorescent reporter strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Erdman) in the deconstructed granuloma model (DGr). Purpose High through-put assaying of ReFRAME library for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the deconstructed granuloma model (DGr) in the presence of INH. To maximize the richness of a screen for compounds that impact progression of Mtb growth through host-directed targets we have developed a screen based on including all the cells present in active murine tuberculosis granulomas.  Protocol In brief, mice are infected with mCherry-expressing Mtb Erdman (103 organisms intranasally) and left for 21 days. At this time point the immune response is in transition. The innate response is still active and the acquired response is developing.  In addition, this is the time of highest bacterial burden.  We hypothesize that this is an ideal time-point because the infection is at its most plastic and all cell types that could impact disease progression (both positively and negatively) are present. To provide a comparison against this assay with the cell type we have utilized before, we have run this with J774 cells in parallel to the DGr-ReFrame. At 21 days the mice are sacrificed and the lungs excised. The tissue is broken down by homogenization and digestion with a cocktail of enzymes including collagenase and DNase1. Large fibrous aggregates are removed by centrifugation and the single cell suspension washed. An aliquot of the suspension is fixed for analysis by flow cytometry. The remainder is seeded into 384 well plates @ 100,000 cells/well (30uL), infected with a second Mtb strain, this time carrying the tetracycline inducible mKO protein (10uL @ 0.2 OD600). The plates are given either DMEM or DMEM with sub-MIC INH (0.0125ug/mL), and the test drug compounds (5uM in 10uL) in parallel. The plates are incubated, and 10uL ATc (final conc. 200ng/mL) is added at day 4 and read by fluorescent plate reader on day 6 and 7 to measure the signal from growing/surviving bacteria.

ReframeDB_A00482	COVID-19 Papain-like protease assay	Biochemical assay on recombinant cystine protease. Enzyme activity is determined by cleavage of a fluorogenic peptid. Purpose COVID-19 Papain-like protease is a cystine protease with an activity comparable to human deubiqutinase enzymes. The papain-like protease allows the virus to evade immune response by interfering with the pathways responsible for the production of interferon-gamma. Inhibitors of this protein may be useful in treating the symptoms of COVID-19 and encourage a more robust immune response.  This assay employs a fluorogenic substrate of the papain like protease, inhibitors are determined as compounds which reduce fluorescence. This assay is also a useful counterscreen for the SARS-CoV2 target C3-Like protease as they are both cystine proteases but do not share any similarity are their active sites.

COVID-19 S protein is labelled with Terbium Chelate and ACE2 is labelled with Alexa Fluor 647/488 Purpose COVID-19 S-protein facilitates entry to the host cell via interaction with the host receptor ACE2. The first stage of viral entry is the protein-protein interaction between the S-protein and ACE2 therefore inhibitors of this interaction will be useful to treat infection. The two proteins are labelled with one of the HTRF pair, terbium and Alexfluor 488/647. If the two proteins are bound upon excitation of the terbium, rather than fluorescing, energy is transferred to the alexfluor dye and light is emitted at a longer wavelength.

ReframeDB_A00413	Toxicity screen on Hit compounds for DENV transmission blocking molecules	Secondary assay for A00378. High Throughput luciferase interference screening for Hit compounds from the primary screen on U4.4_DENV1 stable cell line (mosquito cell line)  Purpose We aim to screen the hit compounds from the primary screen (done previously) to identify the false positives. For this purpose, cytotoxicity assay will be used as the deselection assay. The screen will be carried out in Aedes albopictus U4.4 cells (Argo knockout) expressing DENV1 replicon with a Nanoluciferase based reporter. The U4.4-DENV1 replicon cell line has been stably and successfully maintained for over 30 passages without significant loss of reporter signal. Screen will be done on a 384-well plate using cryopreserved cells, frozen at the same passage. This will save time on culturing cells throughout the screen and will reduce any variations that may be caused due to different cell passages. Fluorescent signal generated by conversion of Resazurin to resoflurin will be used as the measure of viability of the cells. Toxicity assay will be carried out as a dose response screen after the primary single point viral inhibition screen.  Protocol 8 point dose response screen (Hits only): Prespotted assay plates including the positive and negative controls on solid black 384- wells plate ( Catalog number: Greiner Bio-one, 781086). X nl of compound to a final concentration ranging from 10 ÂµM- 3 nM is added to each plate in a final volume of 40 Âµl. U4.4_DENV1 cryopreserved cells are added to each well (5000 cells/40Âµl). Plates are incubated at 26Â°C for 48 hours. 20Âµl of Resazurin substrate is added to each well and fluorescence is measured after 24 hours incubation at 26Â°C.

ReframeDB_A00191	Intramacrophage Mycobacterium tuberculosis	A high content microscopy assay to determine drug activity against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis Purpose Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, exists in a complex set of environments both intracellularly and extracellularly in the host. Most drug screening for tuberculosis has been performed on extracellular bacteria. We are screening for drugs that inhibit M. tuberculosis growth inside macrophages, a primary cell type in which the bacteria reside. This is a high-content image-based assay. Total fluorescence intensity of DsRed-producing M. tuberculosis and nucleic acid-stained macrophages are readouts of growth or survival. Protocol RAW 264.7 cells are propagated in RMPI ( RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 2 mM Glutagro, 1 mM sodium pyruvate medium) in a humidified atmosphere of 37°C, 5% CO2. RAW 264.7 cells are infected with M. tuberculosis (H37Rv DREAM8 strain which constitutively expresses DsRed) at multiplicity of infection of 1.0 overnight. Compounds are diluted in RPMI-1640, 5% FBS with Glutagro and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Infected RAW 264.7 cells are harvested with Accumax solution, washed twice with PBS to remove extracellular bacilli and resuspended in RPMI-1640 with Glutagro and sodium pyruvate (no FBS). Infected cells are  seeded in 384-well plates containing compounds at 3.3 x 10^3 cells per well, resulting in a final assay concentration of 2.5% FBS. After a 72 hour incubation period, SYBR Green I dye is diluted in PBS and added to a final concentration of 5x to stain macrophage nuclei. Cells are imaged on an ImageXpress Micro with a 4x objective. Macrophage nuclei are imaged using a FITC filter set and M. tuberculosis are imaged using a Texas Red filter set. This method has been published: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202316303619?via%3Dihub Readout Images were analyzed by setting a lower bound for pixel intensity for each channel to define nuclei and bacteria above background.The integrated pixel intensity of each channel above this threshold was then determined as a measure of macrophage or M. tuberculosis  growth.

ReframeDB_A00508	Secondary assay counterscreen for SARS-CoV2 spike-mediated entry Inhibitor assay using CellTiter-Glo	Secondary assay for the identification of off target hits from the SARS-CoV2 entry assay using luminescence viability assay. Purpose Entry of coronaviruses requires the sequential functions of two subunits of spike protein (S), S1 and S2 on the viral surface. S1 subunit or more precisely a smaller domain in this region called receptor binding domain (RBD) is primarily responsible for binding to functional receptors on target cells. S2 subunit facilitates the fusion of cell membrane with viral membrane, and its efficiency is determined by priming steps by cellular proteases as well as following conformational change. SARS-CoV-2, the same as SARS-CoV, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for entry. Cleavage of S2’ site in S2 subunit by proteases, such as a serine protease named TMPRSS2, demonstrates a priming function and leads to a more efficient entry mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S. Therefore, inhibitors that either block the interaction of S1 or RBD with cellular receptors or the fusion mediated by S2 domain could inhibit entry of the virus. This secondary assay (1536 well format) will identify off target activity of the inhibitors identified as part of the SARS-CoV-2 primary cell-based assay by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based activity. The luminescence signal is dependent on the amount of ATP available in metabolically active HEK293 cells, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate a reduction in cell viability. This assay is controlled using no cells as the (high control) vs cells treated with vehicle only (low control). Protocol Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  Cells will be transfected with protease, reporter, and control constructs prior to use and 2000 cells in 5uL of media will be plated into each well containing compounds and controls. After 48 hour incubation, 5 uL of CellTiter-Glo Firefly luciferase substrate will be added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes before luminescence reading on Perkin ViewLux.  Readout CellTiter-Glo (Promega) substrate will be used to measure Firefly luciferase luminescence. Activity of the reporter will be measured by Firefly luciferase reporter output. Values will be normalized based on DMSO treated HEK cells Fluc signal (low control) vs. no cells (high control).

ReframeDB_A00225	Promega CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay on Pathogenic Acanthamoeba castellanii	Promega CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay on Pathogenic Acanthamoeba castellanii Purpose Acanthamoeba species cause a 95 % fatal brain disease known as Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis (GAE). Current therapeutics are not effective as they were never optimised as amoebacidal drugs, they are currently used because they have been identified to have some level of activity against these opportunistic parasites. Identification of new drugs and or scaffolds would significantly improve the field for research and or treatments. Amoebae viability is measured by Promega's CellTiter-Glo 2.0. Protocol Calibr plates were prespotted with drug and sent frozen to UGA. Plates were allowed to thaw at room temperature overnight. Plates were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 1 minute. Using the Biomek NXP 40 ¬µl of 1.5x104 cells/ml A. castellanii were seeding into 384 well white, TC treated plates (Corning 3570 flat bottom) and incubated for 72 hours. At the 72 hour time point 10 ¬µl of Promega's CellTiter-Glo 2.0 was added to every well. Plates were shaken for 2 minutes to induce cell lysis and left to sit for 10 minutes to stabilise the luminescent signal.

ReframeDB_A00647	Inhibition of Bodipy-GTP binding to small g-protein Kras-WT from Multiplex	A microsphere-based screen that simultaneously interrogates GTP binding to a set of small G-proteins. Eight GST~G-proteins are coupled to bead sets of varying fluorescence intensity. Flow Cytometry is used to discriminate individual bead bound G-proteins and evaluate Bodipy-GTP binding. Purpose Small GTPases that include the Ras and Rho families regulate a wide range of cell signaling pathways by alternating between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states. In normal physiological conditions, their activities are tightly controlled and aberrant behavior related to an increased presence of GTP-bound forms contributes to tumorigenesis and other diseases. For this reason, the identification of small, cell-permeable molecules capable of modulating GTP-binding in a specific and reversible manner could prove therapeutically useful. This 384-well flow cytometric assay is capable of measuring Bodipy-GTP binding to nine small G-proteins simultaneously  (KRas WT, G13D, G12V, G12D, Q61H; Rac1 WT, CDC42 WT; Rab7 WT; RhoA). Chimeric GST~fusion proteins are bound to glutathione bead sets that are discriminated by differing intensities of red fluorescence of a fixed wavelength. Bodipy-GTP binding is detected using a separate green-wavelength channel. This format allows for the potential identification of selective modulators of GTP binding to particular G-proteins. Both increased and decreased fluorescence of bound Bodipy-GTP can be quantified.    Data listed in this assay shows specifically Kras-WT from the multiplex. Please view the following assays for the other g-binding proteins: Kras-G13D (A00645), Kras-G12V (A00646), Kras-G12D (A00643), Kras-Q61H (A00641); Rac-1 WT (A00640), CDC-42 WT (A00642), Rab-7 WT (A00639), and Rho-A (A00644) Protocol Bead sets (4ÂµM) that have been pre-coupled with GST~GTPase constructs overnight are washed to remove unbound proteins and are kept on ice until use. Assay plates with pre-spotted compounds (10ÂµM for the primary screen, 100ÂµM top concentration for the concentration-dependent analyses) and DMSO controls are assembled by adding 5ÂµL of assay buffer followed by 5ÂµL of the coupled bead set mixtures. The final concentration of each bead set is 200 beads/ÂµL. Compounds are incubated with GTPase~coupled beads for 30 minutes followed by the addition 100 nL of Bodipy-GTP to a final concentration of 10 nL followed by incubation for 1 hour. Assay plates are sampled using a high-throughput flow cytometry platform that delivers air-separated samples to a flow cytometer. Data from individual assay plates are acquired as single files that are subsequently parsed into individual bins with associated fluorescence signatures.    Readout Bodipy-GTP fluorescence associated with each individual bead set is measured after one hour of incubation. Positive and negative control wells are used to calculate Zâ€™ statistics and active hit compounds are selected based on % signal deviation from control well averages.

ReframeDB_A00240	Trypanosoma cruzi Assay	This target-free high-content screen aims to find compounds that are able to eliminate the Trypanosoma cruzi parasites without affecting the host cell viability. Purpose Chagas‚Äô disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The parasite infects human cells and replicates intracellularly. Chagas‚Äô pathology includes cardiomyopathy and/or digestive syndromes (megacolon and megaesophagus). In our screening assay, we use myoblast cell line (C2C12) and infect with T. cruzi parasites. We incubate the compounds for 72 hours, followed by fixation and staining with DAPI. Images are taken from the wells and a software is used to assess number of host cell and number of parasites. The antiparasitic activity is calculated based on the reduction of parasite number compared to the non-treated controls. We use benznidazole as reference drug and positive control (100% parasite reduction). Since we apply a phenotypic readout, we do also quantify cytotoxicity of the compound calculating the number of host cells compared to untreated controls.   Protocol C2C12 and T.cruzi are collected from culture flasks and counted. A batch infection is prepared by mixing cells and parasites in solution (DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x penicillin/streptomycin). Multidrop Combi (Thermo) is used to dispense 10ul of that solution in the assay plates containing the compounds.  Plates are incubated at 37C, 5% CO2 incubators for 72h. After incubation, 5ul/well is aspirated using EL-406 (Biotek) and we dispense 5ul of 8% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to fix the samples using the Multidrop Combi. After at least 30 minutes incubation with PFA solution at room temperature, we aspirate the content and wash one time with isotonic buffer. Next, we add DAPI solution (5ug/ml) for DNA staining for at least 30 minutes before reading the plates in ImageXpress MicroXL (Molecular Devices). The images are analyzed by a custom module algorithm in MetaXpress (Molecular Devices) to determine the number of host cells and number of parasites per well. Readout Automated fluorescence microscope and custom image analysis module Detection Method total number of c2c12 host cells and total number of t. cruzi parasites are counted via a custom module in metaxpress which detects host cell and parasite nuclei. activity is calculated by subtracting the ratio of the parasites to host cells in a compound-treated, infected well from the average of the ratios of parasites to host cells in dmso-treated, infected wells, then dividing by the difference of the average of the parasite to host cell ratios of dmso-treated, infected wells and the average of the parasite to host cell ratios of dmso-treated, uninfected wells, multiplied by 100.

ReframeDB_A00443	Screening for PLD4 enzyme inhibitors	PLD4 are endolysosomal exonucleases that appear to behave as negative regulators of nucleic acid sensing. Inhibitors may be useful as immunological adjuvants for vaccine or cancer applications. Purpose The screen we have developed has been assessed using the LOPAC library. Our assay relies on the exonuclease activity of PLD3 and PLD4. A short oligonucleotide carrying a fluorescein adduct on one base along with a fluorescence quencher (Iowa Black) on the 3 prime end emits enhanced fluorescence upon digestion by PLD3 or PLD4. Inhibitors will suppress this signal. We plan to introduce into plates that are pre-dotted with compounds to be screened a buffer containing enzyme but no substrate. After a 15 min room temperature incubation, the substrate will be added in an equal volume of butter and the reaction allowed to continue for 2 hours at 37oC. FITC fluorescence is then read. We propose to use PLD3 at 2 nM, PLD4 at 100 nM, and substrate at 2 uM. Final concentration of the ReFrame compound inhibitors will be 2 uM.  Protocol Clear 384-well plates are spotted with 10 nl compounds (final conc 2 uM). Then 5 ul enzyme in 1X buffer is added and the plates pre-incubated with compunds for 15 min at room temperature. Next, 5 ul 1X buffer containing fluorogenic substrate (4 uM) is added, and cultured at 37oC for 2 h. One copy of the spotted library will be incubated with 2 uM PLD3, substrate and its optimal buffer. A second copy of the spotted library will be incubated with PLD4, substrate along with its buffer.

ReframeDB_A00383	Development of preclinical candidates for the treatment of NTM disease - M. abscessus Bamboo	In vitro high-throughput phenotypic screen to identify small molecule inhibitors with activity against both Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium species, ideally also active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Purpose This is an in vitro high-throughput phenotypic screen to identify new orally bioavailable preclinical development candidate compounds for the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease caused by both Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium species. NTM are diverse and ubiquitous in the environment and are increasingly being identified globally in association with serious, usually opportunistic, infections in humans. M. abscessus, one of the most commonly identified NTM species responsible for severe respiratory, skin and mucosal infections in humans, is intrinsically resistant to available antibiotics, underscoring the need to identify novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NTM lung disease. Protocol Mid-log (OD600 = 0.4-0.6) cultures of M. abscessus Bamboo and M. avium 11 grown in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium are diluted to OD600 = 0.05 prior to incubation in the presence of the compounds at 37Â°C with shaking at 110 rpm for 3 and 4 days, respectively. Following incubation, percentage growth inhibition is calculated by normalization to Day 0 data and DMSO negative controls as reference. Compounds displaying >85% growth inhibition against both M. abscessus Bamboo and M. avium 11 species are followed up in secondary dose-response screens to identify those with the most potent activity against both organisms. Following selection of the most promising candidate compounds, carried out in consultation with Calibr, further in vitro and in vivo characterization is carried out to facilitate target deconvolution and to determine efficacy in the mouse model of NTM infection.  Readout Read out will measure cell growth as a function of absorbance at OD600; data are normalized to the DMSO carrier in the absence of compound.

ReframeDB_A00254	Growth-based high throughput screening of small molecule libraries against anaerobic microbial choline metabolism	Phenotypic screening looking for growth inhibitors of E. coli when it‚Äôs cultured in minimal media containing choline as carbon source, but that don‚Äôt inhibit growth on glycerol as carbon source. Bacterial growth is the indirect phenotypic signal of TMA inhibition, which will be subsequently evaluated using a LC/MS method. Purpose A prevalent number of bacterial species that inhabit the human gut can utilize the dietary nutrient choline as a source of carbon and energy, while releasing trimethylamine (TMA) as a byproduct. More specifically, the cut gene cluster that contains the genes that code for choline-TMA lyase (CutC) and its activating enzyme (CutD) are responsible to cleaving choline into acetaldehyde and TMA. The former can be used as source of energy via fermentation, whereas the latter is a byproduct of this metabolism. TMA, however, gets excreted out of the human body through the liver, where it gets oxidized to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by the enzyme flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). TMAO has a profound effect on the host's physiology, including the onset of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, and diabetes. Furthermore, the cut gene cluster is found in a prevalent number of gut commensal bacteria, which emphasizes the need to specifically target this microbial pathway. This assay, which is based on a phenotypic high throughput screening, will reveal compounds that interfere with the microbial choline utilization and its transformation into TMA by inhibiting the growth of bacteria when choline is the sole carbon-energy source. Protocol 384-well plates will be filled with compounds previously dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 10 uM. Columns 1 to 22 are the experimental wells. Columns 23 and 24 are controls, containing 60 ug/mL kanamycin, and DMSO, respectively. Each compound will be screened in singlicate. Once we obtain the plates, they will be left to equilibrate in the anaerobic chamber overnight. Next, we will add 50 uL of previously reduced NCE (non-carbon essential) media containing 20 mM choline and inoculate with E. coli MS-200-1 to an initial OD600 ~ 0.1. We will measure OD600 after 7 and 20 h of anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees Celsius. The compounds that inhibit growth on choline (Z-score =<-2) will be re-tested at the same concentration but in NCE media containing 2.5 g/l glycerol (as counter-screening). Those compounds that don't inhibit growth under this condition (Z-score >= 0) will be picked for dose response against TMA generation. Readout The OD600 of the experimental wells will be analyzed in terms of their Z-score (Zscore = [ODwell - ŒºPlate]/Œ¥plate). We will calculate the Z-prime score using the control wells (Z-prime = 1 - [3Œ¥neg-3Œ¥pos)/(Œºneg-Œºpos)] Detection Method for the screening and counter-screening, we will measure od600 in our spectrophotometer located in our coy anaerobic chamber. for tma assay, we will use lc/ms.

ReframeDB_A00156	Discovery of sporontocidals compounds as starting points for novel malaria causal prophylactics	Identification of compounds that target P. falciparum sporozoites through a luminescent viability assay Purpose A transgenic P. falciparum reporter parasite was created by inserting a GFP::luc reporter gene under control of the circumsporozoite promoter in the Pf47 locus. These parasites show strong reporter expression in developing and mature sporozoites. To assess the effects of compounds on viability of sporozoite, salivary gland sporozoites were isolated from infected mosquitoes and incubated with test substance in microtiter plates. Twenty-four hours later, luciferase activity was determined as a measure for parasite viability.     Protocol Fourteen to twenty-two days post infection with NF54-CGL, salivary glands of infected mosquitoes were isolated in L-15 (Leibovitz) medium (Lonza) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and L-glutamine and ground in a glass mortar to free the sporozoites. After determining the sporozoite count with a hematocytometer, sporozoites were diluted to the desired concentration with L-15 medium supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and L-glutamine without (‚Äúincomplete medium‚Äù) or with (‚Äúcomplete medium‚Äù) 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (hi-FBS). For the screenings, 12 ¬µL/well of a 25,000 to 83,000 sporozoite/mL dilution (corresponding to 300-1,000 sporozoites/well) were dispensed using a Multidrop (Thermofisher) or an electronic multichannel (Ovation) in white 384-well plates (Proxiplate 384-TC Perkin Elmer) pre-spotted with the chemical library. For assay development, test of antimalarial drugs and for compounds issued from resynthesis, 6 ¬µL of a 167,000 sporozoite/mL dilution (corresponding to 1,000 sporozoites/well) were dispensed using an electronic multichannel in white 384-well plates containing 6 ¬µL of compounds diluted at two-fold the final concentration in incomplete or complete medium. In all cases, the compounds had been dissolved in DMSO, and the final DMSO concentration in the assay was 0.1%. Each plate contained vehicle (0.1% DMSO) and positive (100 nM to 1 ¬µM gramicidin) controls, which were used for normalization of the signals. The plates were incubated at 26¬?C with ambient gas in a humidity-controlled incubator for 24 hours, then 6 ¬µL of Bright Glo reagent (Promega) was added to the wells. After a three minute incubation, luciferase activity was measured using a Synergy 2 multi-purpose plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT).   Readout Luminescence Detection Method bright glo reagent (promega) was added to the wells. after a three minute incubation, luciferase activity was measured using a synergy 2 multi-purpose plate reader (biotek, winooski, vt). all plates contained vehicle (0.1% dmso, max signal) and gramicidin (min signal) controls. the values from the min and max controls were used to calculate a z‚äô prime value and to scale the data between 0 and 100% inhibition. compounds showing >50% inhibition were selected for further analysis.

ReframeDB_A00309	Helminth: B. malayi microfilariae (3 Day)	Brugia pahangi worm motility assay Purpose At the University of California at San Francisco, adult female Brugia pahangi worms are used in the primary screens to identify a macrofilaricidal candidate. Adult female Brugia are initially screened in quadruplicate in 24 well plates at a single concentration from 1-10¬µM. Worms treated with 1% DMSO only are used as controls. Worms are kept in a 37¬?C, 5% CO2 incubator for the duration of the assay. Worm motility (phenotypic screening) is assessed on Day 0 (the day worms are treated with compound), Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, and Day 6 using an imaging system called The Worminator. Mean movement units (worms moving are assessed as pixels displaced per second) generated from The Worminator on Day 3 and Day 6 are converted into % inhibitions of worm motility compared to controls treated with 1% DMSO only. A compound hit is defined as one that inhibits the motility of the adult female worm ‚â• 75% by Day 3 of the assay. If a compound inhibits motility of the worms consistently in at least two assays at single concentrations, an IC50 is performed using a 6-point serial dilution starting at 30¬µM. IC50s are calculated using GraphPad Prism. Protocol Based on Bulman CA, Bidlow CM, Lustigman S, Cho-Ngwa F, Williams D, Rasc??n, Jr AA, et al. (2015) Repurposing Auranofin as a Lead Candidate for Treatment of Lymphatic Filariasis and Onchocerciasis. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 9(2): e0003534 with modifications for ReFrame screen Drug screening of adult Brugia worms in vitro Adult female Brugia pahangi were shipped from Univ. of Missouri-Columbia and assayed using methods described by Marcellino et al. (2012). Individual females are placed in each well of a 24-well plate with media (RPMI-1640 with 25 mMHEPES, 2.0 g/L NaHCO3, 5% heat inactivated FBS, and 1X Antibiotic/Antimycotic solution). Worms are transfered to new 24-well plates upon arrival with 500 ŒºL of media per well. Initial ReFrame compound screening is conducted at 3 ŒºM per compound, and 1% DMSO is used as a negative control. All drugs are dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) stock solutions are stored at -20¬?C. Four worms were used as replicates for each concentration and worm plates are kept in a 37¬?C, 5% CO2 incubator for the duration of the assay except during motility readings. To determine the effect of a compound on worm motility, individual worm movements are counted as the number of pixels displaced per second by each worm in each well using the Worminator (see Marcellino C, et al. (2012) WormAssay: A Novel Computer Application for Whole-Plate Motion-based Screening of Macroscopic Parasites. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 6(1): e1494. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0001494). Each plate of worms is video recorded for approximately 60 seconds, and mean movement units (MMUs) are determined for individual worms. Percent inhibition of motility is calculated by dividing the MMUs of the treated worms by the control average MMUs, subtracting the value from 1.0, flooring the values to zero and multiplying by 100%. Videos are recorded each day, including the first day of the assay (Day 0). Compounds that inhibit worm motility can be tested in IC50 assays.

ReframeDB_A00487	Cell Viability Counterscreen for the SARS-CoV2 Protease Inhibitor Assay	Secondary assay for A00461: the identification of off target hits from the SARS-CoV2 papain-like protease assay using luminescence viability assay. Purpose Replication of coronaviruses, including the novel virus SARS-CoV2, requires the processing of two polyproteins by 2 virally encoded proteases. The chymotrypsin-like, 3CL protease cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites, while the papain-like protease (PLpro) cleaves the polyprotein at 3 sites and also cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 form target proteins for innate immune evasion. Inhibitors that block either protease could inhibit replication of the virus, and in the case of the PLpro, alleviate some immune system dampening. This secondary assay (1536 well format) will identify off target activity of the inhibitors identified as part of the PLpro primary cell based assay by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based activity. The luminescence signal is dependent on the amount of ATP available in metabolically active HEK293 cells, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate a reduction in cell viability. This assay is controlled using doxorubicin as a known cytotoxic agent (high control) vs cells treated with vehicle only (low control). Protocol Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  Cells will be transfected with protease, reporter, and control constructs prior to use and 2500 cells in 5uL of media will be plated into each well containing compounds and controls. After 48 hour incubation, 5 uL of CellTiter-Glo Firefly luciferase substrate will be added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes before luminescence reading on Perkin ViewLux.  Readout CellTiter-Glo (Promega) substrate will be used to measure Firefly luciferase luminescence. Activity of the reporter will be measured by Firefly luciferase reporter output. Values will be normalized based on DMSO treated HEK cells Fluc signal (low control) vs. Doxorubicin treated cells (high control).

ReframeDB_A00411	Screening for PLD3 enzyme inhibitors	PLD3 and PLD4 are endolysosomal exonucleases that appear to behave as negative regulators of nucleic acid sensing. Inhibitors may be useful as immunological adjuvants for vaccine or cancer applications. Purpose The screen we have developed has been assessed using the LOPAC library. Our assay relies on the exonuclease activity of PLD3 and PLD4. A short oligonucleotide carrying a fluorescein adduct on one base along with a fluorescence quencher (Iowa Black) on the 3 prime end emits enhanced fluorescence upon digestion by PLD3 or PLD4. Inhibitors will suppress this signal. We plan to introduce into plates that are pre-dotted with compounds to be screened a buffer containing enzyme but no substrate. After a 15 min room temperature incubation, the substrate will be added in an equal volume of butter and the reaction allowed to continue for 2 hours at 37oC. FITC fluorescence is then read. We propose to use PLD3 at 2 nM, PLD4 at 100 nM, and substrate at 2 uM. Final concentration of the ReFrame compound inhibitors will be 2 uM.  Protocol Clear 384-well plates are spotted with 10 nl compounds (final conc 2 uM). Then 5 ul enzyme in 1X buffer is added and the plates pre-incubated with compunds for 15 min at room temperature. Next, 5 ul 1X buffer containing fluorogenic substrate (4 uM) is added, and cultured at 37oC for 2 h. One copy of the spotted library will be incubated with 2 uM PLD3, substrate and its optimal buffer. A second copy of the spotted library will be incubated with PLD4, substrate along with its buffer. Assays will be carried out simultaneously to identify selective inhibitors of each isoform. Readout Plates are read in a fluorimeter for FITC (FAM) fluorescence.

ReframeDB_A00385	XDR Klebsiella pneumoniae amikacin potentiation in the presence of a fixed concentration of amikacin	Identification of potentiators of amikacin against XDR Klebsiella pneumoniae via growth inhibition assay Purpose The goal of this screen is to identify compounds in the ReFRAME library that potentiate the efficacy of the aminoglycoside amikacin against extensively drug-resistant (XDR) K. pneumoniae. Aminoglycosides such as amikacin are important therapeutic options for treating nosocomial Gram-negative infections, but resistant isolates are increasingly reported. Mechanistically, aminoglycosides have the dual advantage of inhibiting protein synthesis, thereby decreasing the expression of bacterial toxins and resistance-mediating enzymes, and permeabilizing the outer membrane. The 384-well screen identifies inhibitors of globally prevalent XDR K. pneumoniae strains, either through potentiation of amikacin and/or direct growth inhibition. This screen is performed following the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines, which recommends using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) reference methods for drug susceptibility testing (ISO 20776-1:2019). These guidelines were adapted to 384-well format to accommodate high-throughput screening and primary screening at single concentration. Protocol Compounds will be pre-spotted onto 384 well microtiter plate (columns 3-22) at 20 ÂµM for primary screen and 40 ÂµM top concentration for dose response together with a fixed concentration of amikacin corresponding to approximately 1/4 x MIC against the XDR K. pneumoniae strains. 5 x 105 CFU/mL of bacteria in Cation-Adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth (CAMHB) are then dispensed to wells in columns 1-23 to a final volume of 50 Âµl per well. CAMHB only is added to wells in column 24. Control conditions are bacteria only (16 wells, column 1), bacteria plus amikacin at 1/4x MIC (16 wells, columns 2), bacteria plus positive drug control apramycin (2 times 8-pt dose-response, column 23) and CAMHB only wells (16 wells, column 24).

ReframeDB_A00212	Crypto-C. hominis high-content imaging proliferation	Phenotypic high-content imaging-based high-throughput screen against the protozoan pathogen C. parvum to find new small molecule inhibitors of Cryptosporidium, which causes diarrheal disease in humans. Purpose This is a secondary assay for hits active against C. parvum IOWA (Sterling and Bunch Grass Farm strains). Cryptosporidium parvum and the related species Cryptosporidium hominis cause diarrheal disease in humans. The current standard of care is ineffective in patients most at risk of cryptosporidiosis. This is a confirmatory secondary high-content imaging-based high-throughput screen of the hits from the full deck against the protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium parvum. The assay measures inhibition of parasite proliferation within the human ileocecal colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HCT-8 (ATCC Number?; a commonly used cell line for studying Cryptosporidium spp. in vitro. HCI detection of this cell-based assay allows for concomitant measurement of Cryptosporidium parasite inhibition and host cell cytotoxicity. Protocol This specific ID is for C. hominis (TU502), which has been routinely passaged through neonatal gnotobiotic piglets at Tufts University by the Tzipori lab. For the assay, HCT-8 cells are seeded into 1536-well clear-bottom plates and incubated at 37C. 24 hours later, compounds are transferred (1.88 uM for primary screening and 25 uM top concentration for dose-response), and then excysted Cryptosporidium sporozoites and oocysts are dispensed onto cells. 48 hours later, cells are fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells are then washed, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with SuperBlock (Thermo), and finally stained with a 1:10 dilution of Superblock with 1ug/mL FITC-tagged Vicia Villosa lectin and 3uM DAPI nuclear stain. Cells are then washed with PBS-T to remove residual stain and plates are sealed with aluminum adhesive seals. Plates are imaged (10x objective) on the CX5 Cellomics imager using the SpotDetector algorithm. Compounds that inhibit Cryptosporidium proliferation by >= 70% and do not inhibit HCT-8 growth by more than 40% are picked for dose response testing.

ReframeDB_A00529	Calu-3 SARS-CoV-2 HCI_Cell Count	High-content imaging-based assay to identify compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the TMPRSS2+ Calu-3 airway epithelial cell line.  This readout looks at the total number of cells 48hrs post-infection, identifying both compounds that increase the number of cells indicating antiviral activity and protection from virus-induced cell death, as well as compounds that reduce the number of cells, an indication of cytotoxicity. Purpose 384w high-content imaging-based assay to identify compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the TMPRSS2+ Calu-3 airway epithelial cell line.  This assay has two major readouts.  The first looks at the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cells (Assay A00527).  This readout looks at the total number of cells 48hrs post-infection identifying both compounds that increase the number of cells indicating antiviral activity and protection from virus-induced cell death, as well as compounds that reduce the number of cells, an indication of cytotoxicity.

ReframeDB_A00546	Profiling a targeted set of compounds for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity	Secondary assay of targeted compounds with potential anti SARS-CoV-2 activity Purpose Cell Based Screen measuring CPE. Many methods exist for enumerating the infectivity of unmodified viruses, with the most popular being quantification of plaque forming units (PFU) and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50 assay). Both these assays rely on the ability of a virus to cause a cytopathic effect (CPE) in cultured cells. The strength of both assays is that multiple complete rounds of infection are required, and therefore inhibition at any stage of the virus lifecycle can be robustly detected. Fortunately, the CVR has SARS-CoV-2 isolates suitable for plaque and TCID50 assays.  Use of a modified version of the TCID50 assay (quantifying monolayer disruption instead of a diluted endpoint) is an established quantitative assay in use at the CVR, currently adapted for a 96-well plate format.  Fixed cell monolayers can be stained and imaged, to quantify the degree of monolayer disruption. This assay is also compatible with parallel toxicity readings as monolayer integrity, in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be assessed.  Moreover, luciferase based toxicity assays can be run in the same plate. Protocol A549-ACE2 and A549-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were seeded in optical 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer CellCarrier-96 Ultra Microplates Cat# 6055302) at 0.14x105 cells/well and incubated overnight.  The following day, the cells were incubated with a panel of 2-fold serially diluted compounds from (10-point curves in columns 1-10) where the concentrations ranged from 10 ÂµM to 20 nM. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and columns 11 and 12 were incubated with the equivalent dose of DMSO to the highest dose of DMSO used in the 10 ÂµM incubations.  The cells were then mock-infected or infected with a predetermined dose of SARS-CoV-2 that would cause substantial CPE by 72 hrs post-infection. At 72 hrs post-infection 50 ul of cell viability assay buffer is added per well. Plates are incubated at RT for 30 min and then cell viability is read in the plate by measuring luminescence. Subsequently cells (whole plates) are fixed with 8% formaldehyde and stained with Coomassie staining solution (0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250/45% methanol/10% acetic acid).  The air-dried plates were scanned using a Celigo imaging cytometer (Nexcelom), allowing monolayer integrity to be quantified.  Subsequent steps determined by the B&MGF. Readout See original registration forms for all formulas. All calculations are performed by Activity Base XE. Control wells in Activity Base templates are termed Blank and Ctrl. Blank = Low Control and this represent a completely inactive compound i.e. 0% effect (DMSO). Ctrl = High Control and represents a completely active compound i.e. 100% effect, in this instance no SARS-CoV-2 added.  Plate statistics Blank median=Median (Non-excluded blank raw values) High control median=Median (Non-excluded control raw values) When the raw value for Blank is lower than the raw value for the Ctrl the following formulas will be used.

ReframeDB_A00666	M.bovis_bovine TB	A laboratory strain of M. bovis, the main cause of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, and a neglected cause of TB in humans will be studied and bacterial viability will be assessed by GFP fluorescence. Purpose A laboratory strain of M. bovis, the main cause of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, and a neglected cause of TB in humans will be dispensed directly into the assay-ready dry spotted 384 well plates provided by ReFRAME. Preliminary studies will be performed to determine the optimal optical density (and equivalent CFU) of M. bovis to use in the 384 well format using recognized antibacterial compounds as positive controls. Plates will be incubated at 37 oC for an ideal duration of approx.. 48 hrs, to minimise risk of evaporation from wells; however, data will be recorded daily. A reporter strain utilizing pTiGc is currently being constructed by our lab. This dual-reporter strain will enable observation of bacterial viability by constitutive GFP fluorescence, and replication state by inducible TurboFP635 fluorescence. Protocol A laboratory strain of M.bovis (AF2122/97) modified to express the pTiGc (KanR) will be cultured in liquid broth media (Middlebrook 7H9 medium containing 75 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.05% Tween80 and 10% albumin-dextrose-catalase (ADC).) at 37oC with shaking to an approx. OD600 of 1 (this will be determined in preliminary assays with control compounds). This culture will be automatically dispensed by BMG Labtech FLUOstar Omega equipment directly into each well of the pre-spotted 384 well plates provided by ReFRAME at a total volume of 50 uL per well. The plates will then be sealed and incubated at 37 oC, static culture, for 48 hrs (the input OD will be optimized to enable distinction of either growth or killing over this period using positive control compounds). Measurement of bacterial viability will be assessed by GFP fluorescence daily up to ten days. To assess the replicative state of the bacteria, they will be pre-treated with theophylline substrate solution for 24hrs to induce expression of the TurboFP635 reporter, followed by washing and seeding into the 384 well plates. Preliminary studies with control compounds will determine the equivalent CFU that corresponds to the fluorescence values recorded in this assay.

ReframeDB_A00516	Identification of Inhibitors of Vaccinia Virus Infections Using High Content Image Based High Throughput Screening RAW	Primary screen to find inhibitors against Vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. A human and a mouse cell line, treated with the compounds and infected with the VACV will be scored for percentage of infected cells by phenotypic assay Purpose The overarching goal is to identify compounds that inhibit smallpox infections. Since access to variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox is restricted, vaccinia virus (VACV), which is a closely related smallpox virus, is used in our infection assay. A high content image based assay is developed to score virus infections. In this assay, cells are either mock treated or treated with the compounds at 2 hours prior to incubating cells with the virus. Following infection, cells are fixed in 10% formalin and then subjected to immunofluorescence staining to detect viral antigen expressing cells. The images are then collected and analyzed to determine the percentage of cells expressing viral antigen. The assay conditions, such as the cell number, amount of virus and duration of infection are optimized such that virus undergoes multiple cycles of infection to achieve an infection rate of 70-80%. Under these conditions all types of inhibitors irrespective of the stage of the viral life cycle targeted, including entry, replication, assembly and or egress are captured. The assay also determines the compound induced cytopathic effects. Furthermore, to ensure wide coverage of host targets for the compounds, the assay is run in two different cell types, MRC5 and RAW264.7 cells which are primary human fibroblasts and mouse macrophage cell line respectively.   Protocol MRC5 (3500 cells/well) or RAW264.7 (4000 cells/well) are seeded in Aurora ultra-low bottom 384 wells plates in 35uL volume of culture media and incubated at 37o C. The next day, cells are treated with 5uL of the test compounds (whose stock concentration is100uM) such that the final concentration of the compound is 10ÂµM in a total final volume of 50uL. Two hours later, MRC5 and RAW264.7 cells are incubated with VACV at an MOI of 0.7 for 18 hours and at an MOI of 1 for 48 hours respectively in a total volume of 10uL. The final volume of culture media in each well is 50uL. Following infections, cells are fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hours, and then subjected to immunofluorescence staining with 5F8 antibody to detect viral antigen expressing cells. Cells and nuclei are stained with cell mask deep red and Hoechst 33342 respectively. Plates are then imaged on Opera high content imager (Perkin Elmer, MA) with 10x objective capturing 5 fields per well. Infections rates are scored using vendor provided Acapella imaging analysis software.  Each compound is screened in duplicates in two separate plates. Four types of controls are incorporated with in each plate. Control # 1, has 8 wells that are mock infected and treated with 0.1% vehicle control (DMSO). This control serves to set the background fluorescence intensity threshold derived from viral antigen staining. Control # 2 includes 8 wells that are mock infected and treated with a reference inhibitor. Control # 3 has 8 wells that are infected and mock treated with 0.5% DMSO. Lastly, control # 4 includes 8 wells that received both the virus and the reference inhibitor. The reference inhibitor is ST-246, which is a FDA approved drug against smallpox infection and is used at a final concertation of 10uM (AC50 is about 1uM). The four controls described provide two main checks to determine the fitness of the plate for hit analysis. Control # 3 is used to normalize the percentage infection inhibition and percentage cell numbers using Spotfire software (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Control # 1 and # 3 are used to determine the statistical robustness of the assay by evaluating the Zâ€™. Plates with Zâ€™ greater than 0.5 are included for further analysis and serves as the first check point. Control # 4 serves as a second checkpoint to ensure that the reference compound shows >50% inhibition. If both conditions are satisfied then the data is analyzed for hits. Compounds that inhibit more than 50% of viral infection and shows less than 20% cytotoxicity in both replicates are considered as â€œHitsâ€ and selected for secondary dose response analysis.  For secondary dose response analysis, an eight point dose response curve with a starting concentration of 30uM and 1/3rd serial dilution is generated. Dose Response Curves and AC50 values are generated using Genedata (Basel, Switzerland) software.  Readout The two main read outs are the percentage of infected cells and total number of cells in each well. These data are obtained by high content image analysis  Average percentage of infected cells and cell number derived from eight control wells (control # 3) that were infected and mock treated with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control) is taken as 100% and used to normalize percentage of infection inhibition and percentage of cell numbers of each well in the plate. Detection Method by immunofluorescence analysis of viral antigen expression. infected cells are immunofluorescently stained to detect viral antigen expression. the cells and nuclei are also stained with cell mask deep red and hoechst 33342 respectively. images of cells are collected and analyzed to determine the percentage of cells expressing viral antigen. Detection Reagents Cells and nuclei are stained with cell mask deep red and Hoechst 33342 respectively to determine cell number and cellular bounderies. Primary mouse monoclonal antibody 5F8 (in house) and secondary goat anti rabbit Daylight 488 antibody (1:1000) detect viral antigen expressing cells. Components Vaccinia virus (VACV),  MRC-5 primary human fibroblasts, RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell lines and detection reagents Drug Concetration An intermediate daughter plate of 10X concentration at 50 Ã‚ÂµM is first made in cell culture media from the 10mM source plate (110nL transferred from 10mM source). Then 5uL of the compound from the intermediate daughter plate is transferred to the primary screen plate to generate a final concentration of 5 Ã‚ÂµM in 50uL of total volume. This is sufficient to screen VACV in two cell lines at 5 Ã‚ÂµM final concentration, in duplicates. 	gpt-3.5-turbo	['High Throughput Screening', 'High Content Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Staining', 'Dose Response Analysis', 'Image Collection and Analysis']
