GEMS1 Case Control is the case control study preceding this follow-on study. GEMS1 HUAS/HUAS Lite Survey: Three community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Surveys conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1 case control study. Background: The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) was a prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study of the burden, etiology, and adverse clinical outcomes of diarrheal diseases among children aged 0-59 months seeking care at health care facilities during a 36-month period at seven sites in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. GEMS1 aimed to elucidate the more clinically severe medically-attended diarrheal episodes to guide and prioritize efforts to prevent the most life-threatening and disabling illnesses. It is also important to characterize the "less severe" diarrhea (LSD) episodes for which care is sought at health care facilities, recognizing that even though there may be fewer adverse health consequences from these illnesses, the overall LSD burden could be greater because it is more common than "moderate-to-severe" diarrhea (MSD). Whether there are meaningful differences in the distribution of etiologies of LSD compared with MSD also must be understood to optimize diarrheal disease prevention and treatment. Therefore a one-year follow-on study designated GEMS-1A was conducted in which six GEMS sites performed simultaneous case-control studies of both MSD and LSD, and one GEMS site performed a case-control study of MSD only. At the time of these studies, no site had introduced rotavirus vaccine into its Expanded Program on Immunization for young infants. Objectives: The objective of GEMS-1A was to determine whether the findings of GEMS were generalizable to episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD), which represent the majority of paediatric diarrhea in patients presenting to health-care centres. This study was designed to simultaneously examine MSD and LSD. The primary outcomes of the GEMS-1A study were to characterize, for LSD in addition to MSD, the overall and pathogen-specific population-based attributable incidence and the pathogen-specific attributable fraction, and to assess the frequency of nutritional faltering and other adverse clinical consequences among children with these two diarrheal syndromes relative to the control population. The outcomes were assessed by site and age stratum, and across all sites for incidence and nutritional outcomes. Methodology: Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS-1A- four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; ManhiÃ§a, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan). Dates of Data Collection: October 2011- January 2013 Study Design: Case-Control study Eligibility Criteria: Participants at each site belonged to a censused population serially updated for births, deaths, and migrations using a demographic surveillance system (DSS). For case enrollment, sites selected sentinel hospitals or health centers (SHCs) where DSS children sought care for diarrheal illnesses. Cases: All children aged 0-59 months belonging to the DSS population at each site who sought care at a SHC during a 12-month period were screened for diarrhea (>3 loose stools during the previous 24 hours). Episodes eligible for inclusion as MSD were new (onset after >7 diarrhea-free days), acute (onset within the previous 7 days), and satisfied at least one of the following criteria for MSD: Sunken eyes (confirmed by parent/caretaker as more than normal) Loss of skin turgor (abdominal skin pinch with slow [even a brief instant] or very slow [>2 seconds] recoil) Intravenous hydration administered or prescribed Dysentery (visible blood in loose stools) Hospitalized The remaining new and acute diarrhea episodes were considered LSD. Note, in Kenya, almost no LSD cases presented to health centers, so LSD cases were not recruited. Controls: For each case of MSD or LSD enrolled, we enrolled 1-3 community control children without diarrhea in the last 7 days, randomly selected from the site's DSS database within 14 days of the case. Controls were matched to each individual case by age, gender, and residence (same or nearby village or neighborhood as the case). Data Collection: At enrollment, parents/primary caretakers of cases and controls underwent standardized interviews to solicit demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical information. GEMS staff measured the child's length/height. Medical management by clinicians at the SHC and clinical condition upon discharge were documented. A single follow-up home visit was performed ~60 days after enrollment to assess the child's vital status and repeat anthropometric measurements. At enrollment, each case and control provided fresh stool that was placed in cold storage and transport media according to the protocol. If antibiotics were to be administered to cases before stool was produced, two rectal swabs were obtained for bacterial culture pending passage of the whole stool for the remaining assays. With few exceptions, GEMS-1A utilized the same clinical/epidemiologic, microbiologic, data management, and analytic methods described for the GEMS1 36-month study of MSD alone.

Note, in Kenya, almost no LSD cases presented to health centers, so LSD cases were not recruited. Controls: For each case of MSD or LSD enrolled, we enrolled 1-3 community control children without diarrhea in the last 7 days, randomly selected from the site's DSS database within 14 days of the case. Controls were matched to each individual case by age, gender, and residence (same or nearby village or neighborhood as the case). Data Collection: At enrollment, parents/primary caretakers of cases and controls underwent standardized interviews to solicit demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical information. GEMS staff measured the child's length/height. Medical management by clinicians at the SHC and clinical condition upon discharge were documented. A single follow-up home visit was performed ~60 days after enrollment to assess the child's vital status and repeat anthropometric measurements. At enrollment, each case and control provided fresh stool that was placed in cold storage and transport media according to the protocol. If antibiotics were to be administered to cases before stool was produced, two rectal swabs were obtained for bacterial culture pending passage of the whole stool for the remaining assays. With few exceptions, GEMS-1A utilized the same clinical/epidemiologic, microbiologic, data management, and analytic methods described for the GEMS1 36-month study of MSD alone.

GEMS-1A is a one-year follow-on of GEMS looking at both moderate-to-severe diarrhea and less severe diarrhea cases. Each site recruited cases with diarrhea from hospitals or ambulatory facilities and up to three matched community controls per case. Participants were assessed at enrollment and at a 60-day follow-up visit.	Stool Collection	sampling technique	N/A	Stool Collection	ncit	0.959	great

GEMS1 Case Control is the case control study preceding this follow-on study. GEMS1 HUAS/HUAS Lite Survey: Three community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Surveys conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1 case control study. Background: The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) was a prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study of the burden, etiology, and adverse clinical outcomes of diarrheal diseases among children aged 0-59 months seeking care at health care facilities during a 36-month period at seven sites in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. GEMS1 aimed to elucidate the more clinically severe medically-attended diarrheal episodes to guide and prioritize efforts to prevent the most life-threatening and disabling illnesses. It is also important to characterize the "less severe" diarrhea (LSD) episodes for which care is sought at health care facilities, recognizing that even though there may be fewer adverse health consequences from these illnesses, the overall LSD burden could be greater because it is more common than "moderate-to-severe" diarrhea (MSD). Whether there are meaningful differences in the distribution of etiologies of LSD compared with MSD also must be understood to optimize diarrheal disease prevention and treatment. Therefore a one-year follow-on study designated GEMS-1A was conducted in which six GEMS sites performed simultaneous case-control studies of both MSD and LSD, and one GEMS site performed a case-control study of MSD only. At the time of these studies, no site had introduced rotavirus vaccine into its Expanded Program on Immunization for young infants. Objectives: The objective of GEMS-1A was to determine whether the findings of GEMS were generalizable to episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD), which represent the majority of paediatric diarrhea in patients presenting to health-care centres. This study was designed to simultaneously examine MSD and LSD. The primary outcomes of the GEMS-1A study were to characterize, for LSD in addition to MSD, the overall and pathogen-specific population-based attributable incidence and the pathogen-specific attributable fraction, and to assess the frequency of nutritional faltering and other adverse clinical consequences among children with these two diarrheal syndromes relative to the control population. The outcomes were assessed by site and age stratum, and across all sites for incidence and nutritional outcomes. Methodology: Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS-1A- four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; ManhiÃ§a, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan). Dates of Data Collection: October 2011- January 2013 Study Design: Case-Control study Eligibility Criteria: Participants at each site belonged to a censused population serially updated for births, deaths, and migrations using a demographic surveillance system (DSS). For case enrollment, sites selected sentinel hospitals or health centers (SHCs) where DSS children sought care for diarrheal illnesses. Cases: All children aged 0-59 months belonging to the DSS population at each site who sought care at a SHC during a 12-month period were screened for diarrhea (>3 loose stools during the previous 24 hours).

GEMS-1A is a one-year follow-on of GEMS looking at both moderate-to-severe diarrhea and less severe diarrhea cases. Each site recruited cases with diarrhea from hospitals or ambulatory facilities and up to three matched community controls per case. Participants were assessed at enrollment and at a 60-day follow-up visit.

GEMS1 Case Control is the case control study preceding this follow-on study. GEMS1 HUAS/HUAS Lite Survey: Three community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Surveys conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1 case control study. Background: The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) was a prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study of the burden, etiology, and adverse clinical outcomes of diarrheal diseases among children aged 0-59 months seeking care at health care facilities during a 36-month period at seven sites in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. GEMS1 aimed to elucidate the more clinically severe medically-attended diarrheal episodes to guide and prioritize efforts to prevent the most life-threatening and disabling illnesses. It is also important to characterize the "less severe" diarrhea (LSD) episodes for which care is sought at health care facilities, recognizing that even though there may be fewer adverse health consequences from these illnesses, the overall LSD burden could be greater because it is more common than "moderate-to-severe" diarrhea (MSD). Whether there are meaningful differences in the distribution of etiologies of LSD compared with MSD also must be understood to optimize diarrheal disease prevention and treatment. Therefore a one-year follow-on study designated GEMS-1A was conducted in which six GEMS sites performed simultaneous case-control studies of both MSD and LSD, and one GEMS site performed a case-control study of MSD only. At the time of these studies, no site had introduced rotavirus vaccine into its Expanded Program on Immunization for young infants. Objectives: The objective of GEMS-1A was to determine whether the findings of GEMS were generalizable to episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD), which represent the majority of paediatric diarrhea in patients presenting to health-care centres. This study was designed to simultaneously examine MSD and LSD. The primary outcomes of the GEMS-1A study were to characterize, for LSD in addition to MSD, the overall and pathogen-specific population-based attributable incidence and the pathogen-specific attributable fraction, and to assess the frequency of nutritional faltering and other adverse clinical consequences among children with these two diarrheal syndromes relative to the control population. The outcomes were assessed by site and age stratum, and across all sites for incidence and nutritional outcomes. Methodology: Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS-1A- four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; ManhiÃ§a, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan). Dates of Data Collection: October 2011- January 2013 Study Design: Case-Control study Eligibility Criteria: Participants at each site belonged to a censused population serially updated for births, deaths, and migrations using a demographic surveillance system (DSS). For case enrollment, sites selected sentinel hospitals or health centers (SHCs) where DSS children sought care for diarrheal illnesses. Cases: All children aged 0-59 months belonging to the DSS population at each site who sought care at a SHC during a 12-month period were screened for diarrhea (>3 loose stools during the previous 24 hours). Episodes eligible for inclusion as MSD were new (onset after >7 diarrhea-free days), acute (onset within the previous 7 days), and satisfied at least one of the following criteria for MSD: Sunken eyes (confirmed by parent/caretaker as more than normal) Loss of skin turgor (abdominal skin pinch with slow [even a brief instant] or very slow [>2 seconds] recoil) Intravenous hydration administered or prescribed Dysentery (visible blood in loose stools) Hospitalized The remaining new and acute diarrhea episodes were considered LSD. Note, in Kenya, almost no LSD cases presented to health centers, so LSD cases were not recruited. Controls: For each case of MSD or LSD enrolled, we enrolled 1-3 community control children without diarrhea in the last 7 days, randomly selected from the site's DSS database within 14 days of the case. Controls were matched to each individual case by age, gender, and residence (same or nearby village or neighborhood as the case). Data Collection: At enrollment, parents/primary caretakers of cases and controls underwent standardized interviews to solicit demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical information. GEMS staff measured the child's length/height. Medical management by clinicians at the SHC and clinical condition upon discharge were documented. A single follow-up home visit was performed ~60 days after enrollment to assess the child's vital status and repeat anthropometric measurements. At enrollment, each case and control provided fresh stool that was placed in cold storage and transport media according to the protocol. If antibiotics were to be administered to cases before stool was produced, two rectal swabs were obtained for bacterial culture pending passage of the whole stool for the remaining assays. With few exceptions, GEMS-1A utilized the same clinical/epidemiologic, microbiologic, data management, and analytic methods described for the GEMS1 36-month study of MSD alone.

2	clinepidb_DS_4d72506014	ClinEpiDB	Asia Pacific ICEMR Cambodian Cross-sectional	Background: In Cambodia, significant achievements have been made over the past decade in reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality. However, transmission is endemic in 21 of 25 provinces and it is estimated that 58% of the population, or approximately 8.6 million people, continue to live in malaria at-risk areas. The incidence of clinical cases is highest in the north-eastern part of the country, with the highest risk in forest or forest fringe areas of the country, usually found along the borders. It is therefore very important to i) characterize region specific demographic and geographic determinants of (especially asymptomatic) malaria infection ii) determine the relationship between different measures of malaria infection and exposure and iii) implement malaria surveillance and control strategies using this knowledge to optimise the distribution of limited resources to detect as many infections as possible. Objectives: To determine age-specific prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infections by qPCR and light microscopy To investigate individual and spatial risk factors for Plasmodium spp. infections To determine the genetic complexity of Plasmodium spp. infections within and between populations To determine the prevalence of antibodies to panels P. falciparum and P. vivax antigens To determine the prevalence of molecular markers of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax parasites.

However, transmission is endemic in 21 of 25 provinces and it is estimated that 58% of the population, or approximately 8.6 million people, continue to live in malaria at-risk areas. The incidence of clinical cases is highest in the north-eastern part of the country, with the highest risk in forest or forest fringe areas of the country, usually found along the borders. It is therefore very important to i) characterize region specific demographic and geographic determinants of (especially asymptomatic) malaria infection ii) determine the relationship between different measures of malaria infection and exposure and iii) implement malaria surveillance and control strategies using this knowledge to optimise the distribution of limited resources to detect as many infections as possible. Objectives: To determine age-specific prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infections by qPCR and light microscopy To investigate individual and spatial risk factors for Plasmodium spp. infections To determine the genetic complexity of Plasmodium spp. infections within and between populations To determine the prevalence of antibodies to panels P. falciparum and P. vivax antigens To determine the prevalence of molecular markers of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax parasites. Determine the prevalence and type of G6PD deficiency and CYP 2D6 polymorphisms Methodology: Household-based cross-sectional prevalence survey with collection of epidemiological data associated with risk of malaria and biological samples to determine current infection status.

3	clinepidb_DS_4d0fe88b6b	ClinEpiDB	SCORE Niger S. haematobium Cluster Randomized Trial	Related studies: SCORE Mozambique S. haematobium Cluster Randomized Trial SCORE S. mansoni Cluster Randomized Trial Background: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. It is estimated that 3.2 million people are infected with schistosomiasis in Niger. Mass drug administration (MDA) with the drug praziquantel is the mainstay of schistosomiasis control. Existing thresholds for implementation of mass treatment for schistosomiasis needed refinement and a better evidence base to establish the relative benefits of different age-group coverage formats and different schedules of targeted mass praziquantel delivery. There was interest in finding out whether, when compared with school-based treatment, using one or more years of community-wide treatment would have a greater impact on the prevalence and intensity of infection if, for example, community-wide treatment could achieve better coverage of school-aged children who did not attend school or better coverage of high-risk adults. There also was a lack of data as to whether every-other-year delivery of MDA could be sufficient for morbidity control. Objectives: The primary research question addressed in this study is which MDA strategy- annual versus biannual school-based treatment or community-wide treatment - provided the greatest reduction in prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection among 9-12 year-olds after four years of intervention. In addition, the impact of treatment on first-year students and adults was also assessed. Methodology Study Sites: The study was conducted in 225 villages in nine districts in Western Niger along the Niger River Valley- the region of Tillabery (Kollo, Say, Tera, FilinguÃ© and Tillabery districts), Dosso (Loga district) and Niamey (districts 1-3). Dates of Data Collection: 2011- 2015 Study Design: Cluster-randomized trial Data Collection Sampling: A total of 225 villages were enrolled in the study, with 100 children aged 9-12 years tested each year per village. In addition, systematic random sampling was used in each village to select a further 100 first-year students (aged 5-8 years) in all 225 villages at the first and fifth years only. A convenience sample of 50 adults (aged 22-50 years) were sampled in the first and last year of villages with a starting S. haematobium prevalence over 25%. Village-level data: Data was collected from each study village on geographic location (latitude, longitude) and data related to MDA coverage- total village population, population treated by MDA, number of school-aged children, number of school-aged children treated by MDA. Individual-level data: Demographic data on age and sex was collected from each participant. A single urine sample was collected from each individual in the study for assessment of the S. haematobium egg burden by urine filtration and microscopy. ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as cleaned .csv files with all personal identifiers removed. All dates were obfuscated per individual through the application of a random number algorithm that shifted dates no more than seven days to comply with the ethical conduct of human subjects research.

Finally, we thank all the children, parents, teachers, and village leaders who participated in this study. Financial Support: SCORE is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through a grant to the University of Georgia Research Foundation (UGARF). Ethics Statement: The study protocol has been approved by the National Ethics Committee in Niger (ref 012/2010/CCNE) and Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (ref ICREC_8_2_2). In addition to these, the University of Georgia institutional review board IRB implemented an administrative human subjects review and issued additional approval 10533-0 for Niger. Informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of all pupils involved in the study and verbal consent was also obtained from all adults included. The purpose of the study was explained to education and health authorities. All results in the datasets were anonymous and coded to prevent association with the individual participant. Last Updated: March 8, 2021To provide an evidence base for cost-effective schistosomiasis control, a five-year study cluster-randomised trial in Niger investigated six possible combinations of annual or biannual community-wide treatment, school-based treatment, and holidays from mass treatment over four years. The primary outcome of interest was prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma haematobium among 100 children aged 9-12 years sampled each year in each village. The relative reduction of prevalence was greater in biannual compared with annual treatment across all arms; however, the only significant difference was seen in areas with a high starting prevalence.

There was interest in finding out whether, when compared with school-based treatment, using one or more years of community-wide treatment would have a greater impact on the prevalence and intensity of infection if, for example, community-wide treatment could achieve better coverage of school-aged children who did not attend school or better coverage of high-risk adults. There also was a lack of data as to whether every-other-year delivery of MDA could be sufficient for morbidity control. Objectives: The primary research question addressed in this study is which MDA strategy- annual versus biannual school-based treatment or community-wide treatment - provided the greatest reduction in prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection among 9-12 year-olds after four years of intervention. In addition, the impact of treatment on first-year students and adults was also assessed. Methodology Study Sites: The study was conducted in 225 villages in nine districts in Western Niger along the Niger River Valley- the region of Tillabery (Kollo, Say, Tera, FilinguÃ© and Tillabery districts), Dosso (Loga district) and Niamey (districts 1-3). Dates of Data Collection: 2011- 2015 Study Design: Cluster-randomized trial Data Collection Sampling: A total of 225 villages were enrolled in the study, with 100 children aged 9-12 years tested each year per village. In addition, systematic random sampling was used in each village to select a further 100 first-year students (aged 5-8 years) in all 225 villages at the first and fifth years only. A convenience sample of 50 adults (aged 22-50 years) were sampled in the first and last year of villages with a starting S. haematobium prevalence over 25%. Village-level data: Data was collected from each study village on geographic location (latitude, longitude) and data related to MDA coverage- total village population, population treated by MDA, number of school-aged children, number of school-aged children treated by MDA. Individual-level data: Demographic data on age and sex was collected from each participant. A single urine sample was collected from each individual in the study for assessment of the S. haematobium egg burden by urine filtration and microscopy. ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as cleaned .csv files with all personal identifiers removed. All dates were obfuscated per individual through the application of a random number algorithm that shifted dates no more than seven days to comply with the ethical conduct of human subjects research.

Last Updated: March 8, 2021To provide an evidence base for cost-effective schistosomiasis control, a five-year study cluster-randomised trial in Niger investigated six possible combinations of annual or biannual community-wide treatment, school-based treatment, and holidays from mass treatment over four years. The primary outcome of interest was prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma haematobium among 100 children aged 9-12 years sampled each year in each village. The relative reduction of prevalence was greater in biannual compared with annual treatment across all arms; however, the only significant difference was seen in areas with a high starting prevalence.	systematic random sampling	sampling technique	N/A	Systematic Sampling	ncit	0.843	good

An understanding of the mechanisms by which humans acquire malaria immunity through repeated P. falciparum infections may aid the development of a malaria vaccine. Since May 2011 this observational cohort study has been conducted in Kalifabougou, Mali as a close collaboration between the Malaria Research and Training Center at the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health. Kalifabougou is a rural village of approximately 5000 inhabitants located 48 km northwest of Bamako in a region of Mali that typically experiences intense, seasonal P. falciparum transmission from July through December. Objectives: Better understand fundamental aspects of malaria epidemiology, the human immune response to malaria, and the biology of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the context of intense seasonal malaria transmission. Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: Kalifabougou, Mali Dates of Data Collection: May 2011 to present (ongoing) Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study Eligibility Criteria: From an age-stratified, random sample of the entire village population, 695 healthy individuals aged 3 months-25 years were initially enrolled, with periodic enrollment of new healthy volunteers subsequently. The disproportionate sample size of each age group reflects the design of this ongoing study of malaria immunity, which focuses on older children as they transition from malaria susceptibility to immunity. Enrollment exclusion criteria are hemoglobin level <7 g/dL, axillary temperature â‰¥37.5Â°C, acute systemic illness, use of antimalarial or immunosuppressive medications in the past 30 days, and pregnancy. Data Collection: Clinical malaria episodes are detected prospectively by self-referral and by weekly or monthly active clinical surveillance visits depending on the study year. All individuals with signs and symptoms of malaria and any level of Plasmodium parasitemia detected by light microscopy are treated according to the National Malaria Control Program guidelines in Mali. In general, the research definition of malaria is an axillary temperature of â‰¥37.5Â°C, â‰¥2500 asexual parasites/ÂµL of blood, and no other cause of fever discernible by physical exam. During the scheduled clinic visits that occur before, during and after each malaria season, and at the first research-defined malaria episode of each malaria season, blood is collected by finger prick to prepare blood smears and dried blood spots on filter paper, and venous blood is collected to isolate and cryopresrve peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma. Study Documentation: Case report forms (zip file) Data dictionaries (zip file) ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as flat txt files. These datasets were merged by unique ID and redundant or administrative columns were dropped from presentation on ClinEpiDB.org.

All individuals with signs and symptoms of malaria and any level of Plasmodium parasitemia detected by light microscopy are treated according to the National Malaria Control Program guidelines in Mali. In general, the research definition of malaria is an axillary temperature of â‰¥37.5Â°C, â‰¥2500 asexual parasites/ÂµL of blood, and no other cause of fever discernible by physical exam. During the scheduled clinic visits that occur before, during and after each malaria season, and at the first research-defined malaria episode of each malaria season, blood is collected by finger prick to prepare blood smears and dried blood spots on filter paper, and venous blood is collected to isolate and cryopresrve peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma.

An understanding of the mechanisms by which humans acquire malaria immunity through repeated P. falciparum infections may aid the development of a malaria vaccine. Since May 2011 this observational cohort study has been conducted in Kalifabougou, Mali as a close collaboration between the Malaria Research and Training Center at the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health. Kalifabougou is a rural village of approximately 5000 inhabitants located 48 km northwest of Bamako in a region of Mali that typically experiences intense, seasonal P. falciparum transmission from July through December. Objectives: Better understand fundamental aspects of malaria epidemiology, the human immune response to malaria, and the biology of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the context of intense seasonal malaria transmission. Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: Kalifabougou, Mali Dates of Data Collection: May 2011 to present (ongoing) Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study Eligibility Criteria: From an age-stratified, random sample of the entire village population, 695 healthy individuals aged 3 months-25 years were initially enrolled, with periodic enrollment of new healthy volunteers subsequently. The disproportionate sample size of each age group reflects the design of this ongoing study of malaria immunity, which focuses on older children as they transition from malaria susceptibility to immunity. Enrollment exclusion criteria are hemoglobin level <7 g/dL, axillary temperature â‰¥37.5Â°C, acute systemic illness, use of antimalarial or immunosuppressive medications in the past 30 days, and pregnancy.

Controls were randomly selected from the community and age-frequency matched to cases. Data Collection: Multiple specimens were collected from each case and control and tested for over 30 pathogens. Data were collected on clinical signs and symptoms, medical history, chest x-ray results, lab results, treatment, outcomes, and demographic, household, and environmental risk factors. Study Documentation: The PERCH Background and Methods page provides links to download the study protocol, CRFs, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical, laboratory, data, and regulatory procedures. Additional Resources: PERCH has published two supplements in Clinical Infectious Diseases: Rationale and Study Design for PERCH - contains 15 papers Basis for the Primary Etiology Results - contains 23 papers The PERCH team has also created a website where you can explore PERCH results through interactive visualizations. ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as SAS files. These datasets were converted to txt files and merged by unique ID and redundant or administrative columns were dropped from presentation on ClinEpiDB.org. All dates were obfuscated per participant through the application of a random number algorithm that shifted dates no more than seven days to comply with the ethical conduct of human subjects research. Acknowledgements: Thank you to the families and children who participated in PERCH. Financial Support: PERCH was supported by a grant from The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Last Updated: December 23, 2021The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study was a prospective, multi-center, case-control study of respiratory disease in children 1-59 months of age. Each site recruited cases with severe or very severe pneumonia from hospitals, randomly selected controls from the community, and age-frequency matched cases and controls. Participant observations were assessed at enrollment, and cases were followed up at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 30 days.

14	clinepidb_DS_0086998c2f	ClinEpiDB	SHINE Cluster Randomized Trial	Related studies: WASH Benefits Bangladesh WASH Benefits Kenya Background: Childhood stunting and anemia are a perverse public health problem in developing countries. Globally, stunting affects 26% of children under the age of five and underlies 15-17% of their mortality. Stunting has been shown to lead to long-term cognitive deficits, few years and poorer performance in school, lower economic productivity as adults and a higher risk of stunting in their own children. Objectives: The SHINE trial was motivated by a two part premise. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EDD) is a major cause of child stunting and anemia Primary cause of EED is infant ingestion of fecal microbes due to living condition of poor quality and quantity of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) Primary study objective: Determine the independent and combined effects of improved household WASH and improved IYCF on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV negative women in rural Zimbabwe. Secondary study objectives: Examine the effects of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on stunting (LAZ less than -2) anemia (hemoglobin less than 105 g/L) among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV-negative women in rural Zimbabwe. Examine differential effects on length and hemoglobin concentration at 18 mo of the 2 randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) in these prespecified subgroups: children born to HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative mothers; male and female children; Subgroups formed by categorizing household wealth, household distance from a water point, and maternal capabilities. Examine the independent and combined effects of the 2 randomized interventions on body weight, mid-upper arm circumference and head circumference at 18 mo, and on all anthropometric measures at intermediate ages (1, 3, 6, and 12 mo). Describe the PIP linking implementation of each randomized intervention (WASH and IYCF) with length and hemoglobin concentrations. Assess potential effect modifiers along the PIP Describe the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among all infants enrolled in the trial by maternal/infant HIV status. Evaluate the effect of the IYCF intervention on uptake of improved infant feeding practices by maternal/infant HIV status. Evaluate the effect of the WASH intervention on the five key behaviors it promotes by maternal/infant HIV status: proper disposal of animal and human feces; handwashing with soap after fecal contact; point-of-use chlorination of drinking water; protecting children from ingestion of dirt and feces; feeding baby freshly prepared foods, or reheating leftover food. Elucidate the biological pathways linking WASH and IYCF with linear growth and hemoglobin concentration by measuring domains of EED, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status. Measure the impact of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on incidence, prevalence, and severity of diarrheal disease in infants, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status Model the relative contributions of diarrheal disease and EED in mediating the effects of improved WASH on child length and hemoglobin concentrations, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status Measure the strength of association between severity of maternal EED and systemic inflammation during pregnancy with the risk of 6 adverse birth outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, fetal stunting, low birth weight and neonatal death), stratified by maternal HIV status. Measure the strength of association between other potential causes of stunting and anemia (other than poorWASH or IYCF) with linear growth and hemoglobin. Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: The SHINE study was conducted in the contiguous districts of Chirumanzu and Shurugwi in Zimbabwe. These districts were chosen based of the following criteria: Rural districts with low sanitation coverage (53% for these districts, with 45% open defecation) High prevalence of child stunting (mean LAZ at 18 months and 24 months, -1.89 and -1.97) Reasonable road access throughout the year District level primary healthcare services that offer facility-based antenatal care and deliveries Geographically contiguousness Stakeholder receptivity Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - June 2017 Study Design: SHINE was a cluster-randomized, community-base 2 x 2 factoral trial in two contiguous districts in Zimbabwe. The study area was divided into 212 clusters. Each clusters were allocated (1:1:1:1) to one of the four treatment groups: (1) standard of care, (2) infant and young child feeding, (3) WASH or (4) sanitation/hygiene and nutrition. Eligibility Criteria: Women were eligible for inclusion if they permanently resided in a study cluster and were confirmed pregnant. During the recruitment period, the cutoff of gestational age for eligibility was gradually loosened (from 14 weeks' gestational age to just before parturition) to maximise recruitment. Study Arms: In the standard-of-care group, village health workers promoted exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, advised on neonatal care, and promoted uptake of Ministry of Health and Child Care services, including antenatal care, immunizations, and family planning. In the WASH group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages, plus information about safe disposal of feces, handwashing with soap at key times, protection of infants from geophagia and ingestion of animal feces, chlorination of drinking water (especially for infants), and hygienic preparation of complementary food. Additionally, ventilated improved pit latrines were constructed and two handwashing stations were installed by community builders supervised by Ministry of Health and Child Care environmental health technicians within 6 weeks of enrolment. A plastic mat and play yard were delivered to the home by a trial logistician at 2 and 6 months postnatal, respectively, and village health workers made monthly deliveries of soap from the time of the handwashing module (roughly 30 weeks antenatal) and chlorine from the time of the water treatment module (4 months postnatal) until 18 months postnatal. In the IYCF group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages plus information about the importance of nutrition for infant health, growth, and development; feeding nutrient-dense food and 20 g of a small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement daily from age 6 to 18 months; processing foods to facilitate mastication and swallowing; feeding during illness; and dietary diversity. Participants also received monthly deliveries of 30 sachets of the small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement from infant age 6 months to 18 months postnatal. In the combined group, participants received all standard-of-care, WASH, and IYCF interventions. Data Collection: Research nurses made home visits at baseline (roughly 2 weeks after mothers provided consent), 32 weeks' gestation, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post partum to assess maternal and household characteristics and trial outcomes. Intervention uptake was assessed at all visits and reported here as prespecified for the 12-month postnatal visit. At baseline, mothers' height, weight, mid-upper-arm circumference, and haemoglobin concentrations were measured. They were also tested for Schistosoma haematobium (by urinary microscopy) and HIV (via the rapid test algorithm). Other maternal and household characteristics assessed included dietary diversity, food insecurity, household wealth, and maternal capabilities.

Last Updated: February 14, 2023The SHINE trial was a cluster-randomized trial that sought to determine the independent and combined effects of improved household water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 months of age living in 2 rural districts in Zimbabwe. Clusters were defined as a catchment area of 1-4 community-based village health workers from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care. Clusters were randomized to one of four intervention arms - 1) standard of care, 2) infant and young child feeding intervention (IYCF), 3) WASH intervention, and 4) combined IYCF + WASH. Data collection was performed at baseline, 32 weeks gestation and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months postpartum.	Cluster randomized trial	measurementTechnique	Treatment effect	Randomization	ncit	0.753	ok

Globally, stunting affects 26% of children under the age of five and underlies 15-17% of their mortality. Stunting has been shown to lead to long-term cognitive deficits, few years and poorer performance in school, lower economic productivity as adults and a higher risk of stunting in their own children. Objectives: The SHINE trial was motivated by a two part premise. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EDD) is a major cause of child stunting and anemia Primary cause of EED is infant ingestion of fecal microbes due to living condition of poor quality and quantity of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) Primary study objective: Determine the independent and combined effects of improved household WASH and improved IYCF on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV negative women in rural Zimbabwe. Secondary study objectives: Examine the effects of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on stunting (LAZ less than -2) anemia (hemoglobin less than 105 g/L) among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV-negative women in rural Zimbabwe. Examine differential effects on length and hemoglobin concentration at 18 mo of the 2 randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) in these prespecified subgroups: children born to HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative mothers; male and female children; Subgroups formed by categorizing household wealth, household distance from a water point, and maternal capabilities. Examine the independent and combined effects of the 2 randomized interventions on body weight, mid-upper arm circumference and head circumference at 18 mo, and on all anthropometric measures at intermediate ages (1, 3, 6, and 12 mo). Describe the PIP linking implementation of each randomized intervention (WASH and IYCF) with length and hemoglobin concentrations. Assess potential effect modifiers along the PIP Describe the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among all infants enrolled in the trial by maternal/infant HIV status. Evaluate the effect of the IYCF intervention on uptake of improved infant feeding practices by maternal/infant HIV status. Evaluate the effect of the WASH intervention on the five key behaviors it promotes by maternal/infant HIV status: proper disposal of animal and human feces; handwashing with soap after fecal contact; point-of-use chlorination of drinking water; protecting children from ingestion of dirt and feces; feeding baby freshly prepared foods, or reheating leftover food. Elucidate the biological pathways linking WASH and IYCF with linear growth and hemoglobin concentration by measuring domains of EED, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status. Measure the impact of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on incidence, prevalence, and severity of diarrheal disease in infants, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status Model the relative contributions of diarrheal disease and EED in mediating the effects of improved WASH on child length and hemoglobin concentrations, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status Measure the strength of association between severity of maternal EED and systemic inflammation during pregnancy with the risk of 6 adverse birth outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, fetal stunting, low birth weight and neonatal death), stratified by maternal HIV status. Measure the strength of association between other potential causes of stunting and anemia (other than poorWASH or IYCF) with linear growth and hemoglobin. Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: The SHINE study was conducted in the contiguous districts of Chirumanzu and Shurugwi in Zimbabwe. These districts were chosen based of the following criteria: Rural districts with low sanitation coverage (53% for these districts, with 45% open defecation) High prevalence of child stunting (mean LAZ at 18 months and 24 months, -1.89 and -1.97) Reasonable road access throughout the year District level primary healthcare services that offer facility-based antenatal care and deliveries Geographically contiguousness Stakeholder receptivity Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - June 2017 Study Design: SHINE was a cluster-randomized, community-base 2 x 2 factoral trial in two contiguous districts in Zimbabwe. The study area was divided into 212 clusters. Each clusters were allocated (1:1:1:1) to one of the four treatment groups: (1) standard of care, (2) infant and young child feeding, (3) WASH or (4) sanitation/hygiene and nutrition. Eligibility Criteria: Women were eligible for inclusion if they permanently resided in a study cluster and were confirmed pregnant. During the recruitment period, the cutoff of gestational age for eligibility was gradually loosened (from 14 weeks' gestational age to just before parturition) to maximise recruitment. Study Arms: In the standard-of-care group, village health workers promoted exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, advised on neonatal care, and promoted uptake of Ministry of Health and Child Care services, including antenatal care, immunizations, and family planning. In the WASH group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages, plus information about safe disposal of feces, handwashing with soap at key times, protection of infants from geophagia and ingestion of animal feces, chlorination of drinking water (especially for infants), and hygienic preparation of complementary food.

These districts were chosen based of the following criteria: Rural districts with low sanitation coverage (53% for these districts, with 45% open defecation) High prevalence of child stunting (mean LAZ at 18 months and 24 months, -1.89 and -1.97) Reasonable road access throughout the year District level primary healthcare services that offer facility-based antenatal care and deliveries Geographically contiguousness Stakeholder receptivity Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - June 2017 Study Design: SHINE was a cluster-randomized, community-base 2 x 2 factoral trial in two contiguous districts in Zimbabwe. The study area was divided into 212 clusters. Each clusters were allocated (1:1:1:1) to one of the four treatment groups: (1) standard of care, (2) infant and young child feeding, (3) WASH or (4) sanitation/hygiene and nutrition. Eligibility Criteria: Women were eligible for inclusion if they permanently resided in a study cluster and were confirmed pregnant. During the recruitment period, the cutoff of gestational age for eligibility was gradually loosened (from 14 weeks' gestational age to just before parturition) to maximise recruitment. Study Arms: In the standard-of-care group, village health workers promoted exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, advised on neonatal care, and promoted uptake of Ministry of Health and Child Care services, including antenatal care, immunizations, and family planning. In the WASH group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages, plus information about safe disposal of feces, handwashing with soap at key times, protection of infants from geophagia and ingestion of animal feces, chlorination of drinking water (especially for infants), and hygienic preparation of complementary food. Additionally, ventilated improved pit latrines were constructed and two handwashing stations were installed by community builders supervised by Ministry of Health and Child Care environmental health technicians within 6 weeks of enrolment. A plastic mat and play yard were delivered to the home by a trial logistician at 2 and 6 months postnatal, respectively, and village health workers made monthly deliveries of soap from the time of the handwashing module (roughly 30 weeks antenatal) and chlorine from the time of the water treatment module (4 months postnatal) until 18 months postnatal. In the IYCF group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages plus information about the importance of nutrition for infant health, growth, and development; feeding nutrient-dense food and 20 g of a small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement daily from age 6 to 18 months; processing foods to facilitate mastication and swallowing; feeding during illness; and dietary diversity. Participants also received monthly deliveries of 30 sachets of the small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement from infant age 6 months to 18 months postnatal. In the combined group, participants received all standard-of-care, WASH, and IYCF interventions. Data Collection: Research nurses made home visits at baseline (roughly 2 weeks after mothers provided consent), 32 weeks' gestation, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post partum to assess maternal and household characteristics and trial outcomes. Intervention uptake was assessed at all visits and reported here as prespecified for the 12-month postnatal visit. At baseline, mothers' height, weight, mid-upper-arm circumference, and haemoglobin concentrations were measured. They were also tested for Schistosoma haematobium (by urinary microscopy) and HIV (via the rapid test algorithm). Other maternal and household characteristics assessed included dietary diversity, food insecurity, household wealth, and maternal capabilities.

Last Updated: February 14, 2023The SHINE trial was a cluster-randomized trial that sought to determine the independent and combined effects of improved household water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 months of age living in 2 rural districts in Zimbabwe. Clusters were defined as a catchment area of 1-4 community-based village health workers from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care. Clusters were randomized to one of four intervention arms - 1) standard of care, 2) infant and young child feeding intervention (IYCF), 3) WASH intervention, and 4) combined IYCF + WASH. Data collection was performed at baseline, 32 weeks gestation and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months postpartum.	home visits	measurementTechnique	maternal and household characteristics	Visit	ncit	0.77	poor	home healthcare visit	ncit

Globally, stunting affects 26% of children under the age of five and underlies 15-17% of their mortality. Stunting has been shown to lead to long-term cognitive deficits, few years and poorer performance in school, lower economic productivity as adults and a higher risk of stunting in their own children. Objectives: The SHINE trial was motivated by a two part premise. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EDD) is a major cause of child stunting and anemia Primary cause of EED is infant ingestion of fecal microbes due to living condition of poor quality and quantity of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) Primary study objective: Determine the independent and combined effects of improved household WASH and improved IYCF on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV negative women in rural Zimbabwe. Secondary study objectives: Examine the effects of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on stunting (LAZ less than -2) anemia (hemoglobin less than 105 g/L) among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV-negative women in rural Zimbabwe. Examine differential effects on length and hemoglobin concentration at 18 mo of the 2 randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) in these prespecified subgroups: children born to HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative mothers; male and female children; Subgroups formed by categorizing household wealth, household distance from a water point, and maternal capabilities. Examine the independent and combined effects of the 2 randomized interventions on body weight, mid-upper arm circumference and head circumference at 18 mo, and on all anthropometric measures at intermediate ages (1, 3, 6, and 12 mo). Describe the PIP linking implementation of each randomized intervention (WASH and IYCF) with length and hemoglobin concentrations. Assess potential effect modifiers along the PIP Describe the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among all infants enrolled in the trial by maternal/infant HIV status. Evaluate the effect of the IYCF intervention on uptake of improved infant feeding practices by maternal/infant HIV status. Evaluate the effect of the WASH intervention on the five key behaviors it promotes by maternal/infant HIV status: proper disposal of animal and human feces; handwashing with soap after fecal contact; point-of-use chlorination of drinking water; protecting children from ingestion of dirt and feces; feeding baby freshly prepared foods, or reheating leftover food. Elucidate the biological pathways linking WASH and IYCF with linear growth and hemoglobin concentration by measuring domains of EED, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status. Measure the impact of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on incidence, prevalence, and severity of diarrheal disease in infants, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status Model the relative contributions of diarrheal disease and EED in mediating the effects of improved WASH on child length and hemoglobin concentrations, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status Measure the strength of association between severity of maternal EED and systemic inflammation during pregnancy with the risk of 6 adverse birth outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, fetal stunting, low birth weight and neonatal death), stratified by maternal HIV status.

Evaluate the effect of the WASH intervention on the five key behaviors it promotes by maternal/infant HIV status: proper disposal of animal and human feces; handwashing with soap after fecal contact; point-of-use chlorination of drinking water; protecting children from ingestion of dirt and feces; feeding baby freshly prepared foods, or reheating leftover food. Elucidate the biological pathways linking WASH and IYCF with linear growth and hemoglobin concentration by measuring domains of EED, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status. Measure the impact of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on incidence, prevalence, and severity of diarrheal disease in infants, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status Model the relative contributions of diarrheal disease and EED in mediating the effects of improved WASH on child length and hemoglobin concentrations, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status Measure the strength of association between severity of maternal EED and systemic inflammation during pregnancy with the risk of 6 adverse birth outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, fetal stunting, low birth weight and neonatal death), stratified by maternal HIV status. Measure the strength of association between other potential causes of stunting and anemia (other than poorWASH or IYCF) with linear growth and hemoglobin. Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: The SHINE study was conducted in the contiguous districts of Chirumanzu and Shurugwi in Zimbabwe. These districts were chosen based of the following criteria: Rural districts with low sanitation coverage (53% for these districts, with 45% open defecation) High prevalence of child stunting (mean LAZ at 18 months and 24 months, -1.89 and -1.97) Reasonable road access throughout the year District level primary healthcare services that offer facility-based antenatal care and deliveries Geographically contiguousness Stakeholder receptivity Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - June 2017 Study Design: SHINE was a cluster-randomized, community-base 2 x 2 factoral trial in two contiguous districts in Zimbabwe. The study area was divided into 212 clusters. Each clusters were allocated (1:1:1:1) to one of the four treatment groups: (1) standard of care, (2) infant and young child feeding, (3) WASH or (4) sanitation/hygiene and nutrition. Eligibility Criteria: Women were eligible for inclusion if they permanently resided in a study cluster and were confirmed pregnant. During the recruitment period, the cutoff of gestational age for eligibility was gradually loosened (from 14 weeks' gestational age to just before parturition) to maximise recruitment. Study Arms: In the standard-of-care group, village health workers promoted exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, advised on neonatal care, and promoted uptake of Ministry of Health and Child Care services, including antenatal care, immunizations, and family planning. In the WASH group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages, plus information about safe disposal of feces, handwashing with soap at key times, protection of infants from geophagia and ingestion of animal feces, chlorination of drinking water (especially for infants), and hygienic preparation of complementary food. Additionally, ventilated improved pit latrines were constructed and two handwashing stations were installed by community builders supervised by Ministry of Health and Child Care environmental health technicians within 6 weeks of enrolment. A plastic mat and play yard were delivered to the home by a trial logistician at 2 and 6 months postnatal, respectively, and village health workers made monthly deliveries of soap from the time of the handwashing module (roughly 30 weeks antenatal) and chlorine from the time of the water treatment module (4 months postnatal) until 18 months postnatal. In the IYCF group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages plus information about the importance of nutrition for infant health, growth, and development; feeding nutrient-dense food and 20 g of a small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement daily from age 6 to 18 months; processing foods to facilitate mastication and swallowing; feeding during illness; and dietary diversity. Participants also received monthly deliveries of 30 sachets of the small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement from infant age 6 months to 18 months postnatal. In the combined group, participants received all standard-of-care, WASH, and IYCF interventions. Data Collection: Research nurses made home visits at baseline (roughly 2 weeks after mothers provided consent), 32 weeks' gestation, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post partum to assess maternal and household characteristics and trial outcomes. Intervention uptake was assessed at all visits and reported here as prespecified for the 12-month postnatal visit. At baseline, mothers' height, weight, mid-upper-arm circumference, and haemoglobin concentrations were measured. They were also tested for Schistosoma haematobium (by urinary microscopy) and HIV (via the rapid test algorithm). Other maternal and household characteristics assessed included dietary diversity, food insecurity, household wealth, and maternal capabilities.

Last Updated: February 14, 2023The SHINE trial was a cluster-randomized trial that sought to determine the independent and combined effects of improved household water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 months of age living in 2 rural districts in Zimbabwe. Clusters were defined as a catchment area of 1-4 community-based village health workers from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care. Clusters were randomized to one of four intervention arms - 1) standard of care, 2) infant and young child feeding intervention (IYCF), 3) WASH intervention, and 4) combined IYCF + WASH. Data collection was performed at baseline, 32 weeks gestation and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months postpartum.	financial support	header	N/A	Financial Question	ncit	0.598	poor

Globally, stunting affects 26% of children under the age of five and underlies 15-17% of their mortality. Stunting has been shown to lead to long-term cognitive deficits, few years and poorer performance in school, lower economic productivity as adults and a higher risk of stunting in their own children. Objectives: The SHINE trial was motivated by a two part premise. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EDD) is a major cause of child stunting and anemia Primary cause of EED is infant ingestion of fecal microbes due to living condition of poor quality and quantity of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) Primary study objective: Determine the independent and combined effects of improved household WASH and improved IYCF on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV negative women in rural Zimbabwe. Secondary study objectives: Examine the effects of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on stunting (LAZ less than -2) anemia (hemoglobin less than 105 g/L) among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV-negative women in rural Zimbabwe. Examine differential effects on length and hemoglobin concentration at 18 mo of the 2 randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) in these prespecified subgroups: children born to HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative mothers; male and female children; Subgroups formed by categorizing household wealth, household distance from a water point, and maternal capabilities. Examine the independent and combined effects of the 2 randomized interventions on body weight, mid-upper arm circumference and head circumference at 18 mo, and on all anthropometric measures at intermediate ages (1, 3, 6, and 12 mo).

Longitudinal data was collected approximately every three months from February 2013 until March 2015. Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study Eligibility Criteria: Longitudinal cohort participants were identified randomly from census household members from Chennai and Rourkela. Data Collection: Census information was collected once from households in Chennai in Tamil Nadu and Rourkela in Odisha. The survey included questions on household members and animals, facilities, household assets, and bednet and insecticide usage. Members of the longitudinal cohort were visited approximately every 3 months, with follow-up within two weeks for participants who tested positive for malaria. Participants answered questions on demographics, malaria history, use of mosquito protection, recent travel history, and current symptoms. They also underwent a physical exam and blood collected from a finger prick for malaria diagnosis by microscopy, RDT, and PCR, and for downstream analyses such as host or parasite genotyping, or seropositivity studies. A larger volume of blood was collected from RDT positive subjects for additional studies such as parasite whole genome sequencing.

Data from the longitudinal cohort in Nagongera sub-county, Uganda, including corresponding entomological surveillance data, are included in ClinEpiDB. Objectives: Estimating the incidence of malaria, parasite prevalence, and the molecular force of infection among cohort study participants Characterizing factors that determine the malarial force of infection Determining factors that affect the duration, density, and clinical consequences of blood stage malaria infection Assessing the associations between overnight travel and the risk of malaria infection Estimating measures of transmission intensity including the human biting rate, sporozoite rate, and the entomological inoculation rate at the household level Characterizing the species composition of mosquito vectors and the host source of mosquito blood meals Identifing pathogens responsible for non-malarial febrile illness among cohort study participants Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: Nagongera Sub-County, Tororo District, Uganda Dates of Data Collection: October 2017 - October 2019 Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with active and passive malaria case detection and entomological surveillance Eligibility Criteria: Households (defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling structure acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) came from two separate sources: 1) Households that were followed in the previous surveillance study (see the PRISM ICEMR Cohort), 2) new households that were randomly selected from an enumeration list of all households in Nagongera sub-county generated in 2011. Using a computerized number generator, a random sample of households from the enumeration list were selected for screening and approached in the order in which they were selected. Households from the previous study were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household aged 5 years or younger No more than 7 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies New households selected from the enumeration list were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household under 10 years of age No more than 9 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies Participants were enrolled if they met the following eligibility criteria: Household considered their primary residence Agreement to come to the study clinic for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications outside the study Provision of written informed consent (for parent or guardian in case of children) The cohort was dynamic, so any permanent residents that joined the household were screened for enrollment. Participants were withdrawn from the study if they met any of the following criteria: Permanently moved out of Nagongera sub-county Unable to be located for >4 months Withdrew informed consent Unable to comply with study schedule and procedures Data Collection: Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all participants underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear. A household survey was the conducted to collect household-level information on the use of malaria interventions and treatment-seeking practices. All households were given a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN). Cohort Study Follow-Up: Routine visits at the study clinic occurred once every 4 weeks and included a standardized evaluation. At each routine visit, participants under 6 months had blood collected by a finger prick/heel stick and those over 6 months had a venipuncture with 2.5-15 mL of blood collected based on their weight. Blood was used for a thick blood smear, to measure hemoglobin levels (every 12 weeks), for filter paper samples, and stored for additional studies. Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinic open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill. For any participant presenting to the clinic (for a routine or non-routine visit) with documented fever (tympanic temp >= 38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate. Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted every 2 weeks in each household. A collection was done in all rooms where study participants slept. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning. Presence and use of LLINs was also recorded. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or "other") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. Members of the An. gambiae complex were identified by PCR. Sporozoites were identified in individual mosquitoes stored with desiccant using ELISA. Population Level Vector Control Interventions: Universal Long-lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN) campaigns were carried out in November 2013 and June 2017. There have been 7 rounds of district wide indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide. Bendiocarb was administered December 2014-January 2015, June-July 2015, and November-December 2015. Actellic (pirimiphos-methyl) was administered June-July 2016, July-August 2017, June-July 2018, and March-April 2019.

Data from the longitudinal cohort in Nagongera sub-county, Uganda, including corresponding entomological surveillance data, are included in ClinEpiDB. Objectives: Estimating the incidence of malaria, parasite prevalence, and the molecular force of infection among cohort study participants Characterizing factors that determine the malarial force of infection Determining factors that affect the duration, density, and clinical consequences of blood stage malaria infection Assessing the associations between overnight travel and the risk of malaria infection Estimating measures of transmission intensity including the human biting rate, sporozoite rate, and the entomological inoculation rate at the household level Characterizing the species composition of mosquito vectors and the host source of mosquito blood meals Identifing pathogens responsible for non-malarial febrile illness among cohort study participants Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: Nagongera Sub-County, Tororo District, Uganda Dates of Data Collection: October 2017 - October 2019 Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with active and passive malaria case detection and entomological surveillance Eligibility Criteria: Households (defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling structure acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) came from two separate sources: 1) Households that were followed in the previous surveillance study (see the PRISM ICEMR Cohort), 2) new households that were randomly selected from an enumeration list of all households in Nagongera sub-county generated in 2011. Using a computerized number generator, a random sample of households from the enumeration list were selected for screening and approached in the order in which they were selected. Households from the previous study were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household aged 5 years or younger No more than 7 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies New households selected from the enumeration list were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household under 10 years of age No more than 9 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies Participants were enrolled if they met the following eligibility criteria: Household considered their primary residence Agreement to come to the study clinic for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications outside the study Provision of written informed consent (for parent or guardian in case of children) The cohort was dynamic, so any permanent residents that joined the household were screened for enrollment. Participants were withdrawn from the study if they met any of the following criteria: Permanently moved out of Nagongera sub-county Unable to be located for >4 months Withdrew informed consent Unable to comply with study schedule and procedures Data Collection: Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all participants underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear. A household survey was the conducted to collect household-level information on the use of malaria interventions and treatment-seeking practices. All households were given a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN). Cohort Study Follow-Up: Routine visits at the study clinic occurred once every 4 weeks and included a standardized evaluation. At each routine visit, participants under 6 months had blood collected by a finger prick/heel stick and those over 6 months had a venipuncture with 2.5-15 mL of blood collected based on their weight. Blood was used for a thick blood smear, to measure hemoglobin levels (every 12 weeks), for filter paper samples, and stored for additional studies. Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinic open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill. For any participant presenting to the clinic (for a routine or non-routine visit) with documented fever (tympanic temp >= 38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate. Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted every 2 weeks in each household. A collection was done in all rooms where study participants slept. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning. Presence and use of LLINs was also recorded. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or "other") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. Members of the An. gambiae complex were identified by PCR. Sporozoites were identified in individual mosquitoes stored with desiccant using ELISA. Population Level Vector Control Interventions: Universal Long-lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN) campaigns were carried out in November 2013 and June 2017. There have been 7 rounds of district wide indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide. Bendiocarb was administered December 2014-January 2015, June-July 2015, and November-December 2015. Actellic (pirimiphos-methyl) was administered June-July 2016, July-August 2017, June-July 2018, and March-April 2019.

Data from the longitudinal cohort in Nagongera sub-county, Uganda, including corresponding entomological surveillance data, are included in ClinEpiDB. Objectives: Estimating the incidence of malaria, parasite prevalence, and the molecular force of infection among cohort study participants Characterizing factors that determine the malarial force of infection Determining factors that affect the duration, density, and clinical consequences of blood stage malaria infection Assessing the associations between overnight travel and the risk of malaria infection Estimating measures of transmission intensity including the human biting rate, sporozoite rate, and the entomological inoculation rate at the household level Characterizing the species composition of mosquito vectors and the host source of mosquito blood meals Identifing pathogens responsible for non-malarial febrile illness among cohort study participants Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: Nagongera Sub-County, Tororo District, Uganda Dates of Data Collection: October 2017 - October 2019 Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with active and passive malaria case detection and entomological surveillance Eligibility Criteria: Households (defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling structure acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) came from two separate sources: 1) Households that were followed in the previous surveillance study (see the PRISM ICEMR Cohort), 2) new households that were randomly selected from an enumeration list of all households in Nagongera sub-county generated in 2011. Using a computerized number generator, a random sample of households from the enumeration list were selected for screening and approached in the order in which they were selected. Households from the previous study were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household aged 5 years or younger No more than 7 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies New households selected from the enumeration list were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household under 10 years of age No more than 9 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies Participants were enrolled if they met the following eligibility criteria: Household considered their primary residence Agreement to come to the study clinic for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications outside the study Provision of written informed consent (for parent or guardian in case of children) The cohort was dynamic, so any permanent residents that joined the household were screened for enrollment. Participants were withdrawn from the study if they met any of the following criteria: Permanently moved out of Nagongera sub-county Unable to be located for >4 months Withdrew informed consent Unable to comply with study schedule and procedures Data Collection: Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all participants underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear. A household survey was the conducted to collect household-level information on the use of malaria interventions and treatment-seeking practices. All households were given a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN). Cohort Study Follow-Up: Routine visits at the study clinic occurred once every 4 weeks and included a standardized evaluation. At each routine visit, participants under 6 months had blood collected by a finger prick/heel stick and those over 6 months had a venipuncture with 2.5-15 mL of blood collected based on their weight. Blood was used for a thick blood smear, to measure hemoglobin levels (every 12 weeks), for filter paper samples, and stored for additional studies. Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinic open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill. For any participant presenting to the clinic (for a routine or non-routine visit) with documented fever (tympanic temp >= 38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate. Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted every 2 weeks in each household. A collection was done in all rooms where study participants slept. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning. Presence and use of LLINs was also recorded. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or "other") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. Members of the An. gambiae complex were identified by PCR. Sporozoites were identified in individual mosquitoes stored with desiccant using ELISA. Population Level Vector Control Interventions: Universal Long-lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN) campaigns were carried out in November 2013 and June 2017. There have been 7 rounds of district wide indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide. Bendiocarb was administered December 2014-January 2015, June-July 2015, and November-December 2015.

Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning. Presence and use of LLINs was also recorded. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or "other") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. Members of the An. gambiae complex were identified by PCR. Sporozoites were identified in individual mosquitoes stored with desiccant using ELISA. Population Level Vector Control Interventions: Universal Long-lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN) campaigns were carried out in November 2013 and June 2017. There have been 7 rounds of district wide indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide. Bendiocarb was administered December 2014-January 2015, June-July 2015, and November-December 2015. Actellic (pirimiphos-methyl) was administered June-July 2016, July-August 2017, June-July 2018, and March-April 2019.

Data from the longitudinal cohort in Nagongera sub-county, Uganda, including corresponding entomological surveillance data, are included in ClinEpiDB. Objectives: Estimating the incidence of malaria, parasite prevalence, and the molecular force of infection among cohort study participants Characterizing factors that determine the malarial force of infection Determining factors that affect the duration, density, and clinical consequences of blood stage malaria infection Assessing the associations between overnight travel and the risk of malaria infection Estimating measures of transmission intensity including the human biting rate, sporozoite rate, and the entomological inoculation rate at the household level Characterizing the species composition of mosquito vectors and the host source of mosquito blood meals Identifing pathogens responsible for non-malarial febrile illness among cohort study participants Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: Nagongera Sub-County, Tororo District, Uganda Dates of Data Collection: October 2017 - October 2019 Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with active and passive malaria case detection and entomological surveillance Eligibility Criteria: Households (defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling structure acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) came from two separate sources: 1) Households that were followed in the previous surveillance study (see the PRISM ICEMR Cohort), 2) new households that were randomly selected from an enumeration list of all households in Nagongera sub-county generated in 2011. Using a computerized number generator, a random sample of households from the enumeration list were selected for screening and approached in the order in which they were selected. Households from the previous study were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household aged 5 years or younger No more than 7 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies New households selected from the enumeration list were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household under 10 years of age No more than 9 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies Participants were enrolled if they met the following eligibility criteria: Household considered their primary residence Agreement to come to the study clinic for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications outside the study Provision of written informed consent (for parent or guardian in case of children) The cohort was dynamic, so any permanent residents that joined the household were screened for enrollment. Participants were withdrawn from the study if they met any of the following criteria: Permanently moved out of Nagongera sub-county Unable to be located for >4 months Withdrew informed consent Unable to comply with study schedule and procedures Data Collection: Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all participants underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear. A household survey was the conducted to collect household-level information on the use of malaria interventions and treatment-seeking practices. All households were given a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN). Cohort Study Follow-Up: Routine visits at the study clinic occurred once every 4 weeks and included a standardized evaluation. At each routine visit, participants under 6 months had blood collected by a finger prick/heel stick and those over 6 months had a venipuncture with 2.5-15 mL of blood collected based on their weight. Blood was used for a thick blood smear, to measure hemoglobin levels (every 12 weeks), for filter paper samples, and stored for additional studies. Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinic open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill. For any participant presenting to the clinic (for a routine or non-routine visit) with documented fever (tympanic temp >= 38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate. Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted every 2 weeks in each household. A collection was done in all rooms where study participants slept.

Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinic open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill. For any participant presenting to the clinic (for a routine or non-routine visit) with documented fever (tympanic temp >= 38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate. Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted every 2 weeks in each household. A collection was done in all rooms where study participants slept. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning. Presence and use of LLINs was also recorded. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or "other") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. Members of the An. gambiae complex were identified by PCR. Sporozoites were identified in individual mosquitoes stored with desiccant using ELISA. Population Level Vector Control Interventions: Universal Long-lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN) campaigns were carried out in November 2013 and June 2017. There have been 7 rounds of district wide indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide. Bendiocarb was administered December 2014-January 2015, June-July 2015, and November-December 2015. Actellic (pirimiphos-methyl) was administered June-July 2016, July-August 2017, June-July 2018, and March-April 2019.

Data from the longitudinal cohort in Nagongera sub-county, Uganda, including corresponding entomological surveillance data, are included in ClinEpiDB. Objectives: Estimating the incidence of malaria, parasite prevalence, and the molecular force of infection among cohort study participants Characterizing factors that determine the malarial force of infection Determining factors that affect the duration, density, and clinical consequences of blood stage malaria infection Assessing the associations between overnight travel and the risk of malaria infection Estimating measures of transmission intensity including the human biting rate, sporozoite rate, and the entomological inoculation rate at the household level Characterizing the species composition of mosquito vectors and the host source of mosquito blood meals Identifing pathogens responsible for non-malarial febrile illness among cohort study participants Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: Nagongera Sub-County, Tororo District, Uganda Dates of Data Collection: October 2017 - October 2019 Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with active and passive malaria case detection and entomological surveillance Eligibility Criteria: Households (defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling structure acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) came from two separate sources: 1) Households that were followed in the previous surveillance study (see the PRISM ICEMR Cohort), 2) new households that were randomly selected from an enumeration list of all households in Nagongera sub-county generated in 2011. Using a computerized number generator, a random sample of households from the enumeration list were selected for screening and approached in the order in which they were selected. Households from the previous study were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household aged 5 years or younger No more than 7 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies New households selected from the enumeration list were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household under 10 years of age No more than 9 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies Participants were enrolled if they met the following eligibility criteria: Household considered their primary residence Agreement to come to the study clinic for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications outside the study Provision of written informed consent (for parent or guardian in case of children) The cohort was dynamic, so any permanent residents that joined the household were screened for enrollment. Participants were withdrawn from the study if they met any of the following criteria: Permanently moved out of Nagongera sub-county Unable to be located for >4 months Withdrew informed consent Unable to comply with study schedule and procedures Data Collection: Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all participants underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear. A household survey was the conducted to collect household-level information on the use of malaria interventions and treatment-seeking practices.

Households from the previous study were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household aged 5 years or younger No more than 7 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies New households selected from the enumeration list were eligible for recruitment if they met the following criteria: At least two members of the household under 10 years of age No more than 9 permanent residents currently residing in the household No plans for the household to move from Nagongera sub-county in the next 2 years Willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies Participants were enrolled if they met the following eligibility criteria: Household considered their primary residence Agreement to come to the study clinic for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications outside the study Provision of written informed consent (for parent or guardian in case of children) The cohort was dynamic, so any permanent residents that joined the household were screened for enrollment. Participants were withdrawn from the study if they met any of the following criteria: Permanently moved out of Nagongera sub-county Unable to be located for >4 months Withdrew informed consent Unable to comply with study schedule and procedures Data Collection: Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all participants underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear. A household survey was the conducted to collect household-level information on the use of malaria interventions and treatment-seeking practices. All households were given a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN). Cohort Study Follow-Up: Routine visits at the study clinic occurred once every 4 weeks and included a standardized evaluation. At each routine visit, participants under 6 months had blood collected by a finger prick/heel stick and those over 6 months had a venipuncture with 2.5-15 mL of blood collected based on their weight. Blood was used for a thick blood smear, to measure hemoglobin levels (every 12 weeks), for filter paper samples, and stored for additional studies. Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinic open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill. For any participant presenting to the clinic (for a routine or non-routine visit) with documented fever (tympanic temp >= 38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate. Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted every 2 weeks in each household. A collection was done in all rooms where study participants slept. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning. Presence and use of LLINs was also recorded. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or "other") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. Members of the An. gambiae complex were identified by PCR. Sporozoites were identified in individual mosquitoes stored with desiccant using ELISA. Population Level Vector Control Interventions: Universal Long-lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN) campaigns were carried out in November 2013 and June 2017. There have been 7 rounds of district wide indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide. Bendiocarb was administered December 2014-January 2015, June-July 2015, and November-December 2015. Actellic (pirimiphos-methyl) was administered June-July 2016, July-August 2017, June-July 2018, and March-April 2019.

Mosquito collections were performed every 2 weeks, routine clinic visits occurred every 4 weeks, and participants attended a study clinic any time they became ill.

During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD). At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study. Objectives: To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study. Mali and The Gambia recently introduced the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine. Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018 Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list. Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria- Age 0-59 months Belongs to the DSS Randomly selected from the DSS database Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview. Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. The parent/primary caretaker of each selected child was asked whether the child had diarrhea in the previous 7 days. If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where. An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage. The child's vaccination card was examined and the dates that the child received vaccines against rotavirus, oral polio, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus containing vaccine, and the EPI center attended were recorded. Study Documentation: Questionnaires: HUCS English questionnaire HUCS English questionnaire- short version ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as SAS files.

If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where. An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage. The child's vaccination card was examined and the dates that the child received vaccines against rotavirus, oral polio, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus containing vaccine, and the EPI center attended were recorded.

21	clinepidb_DS_6741e4cc0a	ClinEpiDB	VIDA HUCS Gambia Mali Survey	Related studies VIDA Case Control Study VIDA HUCS Kenya Background: Despite considerable progress in reducing diarrhea-related mortality over the past two decades, diarrheal diseases remain the second leading cause of post-neonatal death during the first 5 years of life in developing countries. During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD). At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study. Objectives: To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study. Mali and The Gambia recently introduced the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine. Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018 Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list. Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria- Age 0-59 months Belongs to the DSS Randomly selected from the DSS database Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview. Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices.

However, since the effectiveness of RACD is limited by the low sensitivity of point-of-care tests to detect low-density chronic infections that perpetuate malaria transmission, other approaches may be more effective. Objectives: This cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in a low endemic setting to evaluate the impact of two reactive focal malaria interventions - reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA) and reactive focal vector control (RAVC). The objectives were to: Evaluate the effectiveness of rfMDA, RAVC, and their combination to decrease malaria transmission Evaluate the safety of rfMDA and RAVC, alone and in combination Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: Zambezi Region, Namibia Dates of Data Collection: January 2017-December 2017 Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled open label two-by-two factorial design trial Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study intervention are shown below: Study Arms: Fifty-six census enumeration area (EA) clusters were randomized to: 1) RACD or rfMDA, and 2) RAVC or no RAVC. RACD: rapid diagnostic testing and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) rfMDA: presumptive treatment with AL RAVC: indoor residual spraying using pirimiphos-methyl Data Collection: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting the parasite reservoir in humans (rfMDA versus RACD), in mosquitos (RAVC versus no RAVC), and in both humans and mosquitoes (rfMDA plus RAVC versus RACD only) on the primary outcome of cluster-level cumulative incidence of locally acquired malaria cases, an intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Interventions were administered to the target population within 500 meters of an index case, as randomized. Index cases were defined as passively detected malaria cases that were confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy, irrespective of origin (e.g. local or imported), who were confirmed to reside in or have stayed at least one night in study EA in the previous four weeks. Data on malaria incidence and epidemiological data such as demographics, residence location, travel history, and malaria prevention behavior were collected. Field teams aimed to visit the index case household and eligible neighboring households within seven days but up to five weeks from the report of an index case, prioritizing households that were closest to the index case. To cover â‰¥80% of individuals or households within 500 meters of index cases, field teams aimed to deliver RACD or rfMDA to at least 25 individuals and RAVC (if indicated) to at least 7 households. Epidemiological data were collected on password secured tablets with pre-coded questionnaires programmed in Open Data Kit (ODK version 1.23.3). Tablet data was uploaded to a secure, firewall- and password-protected server. During the RACD intervention and during the endline cross-sectional survey, consenting individuals received malaria RDT testing and a dried blood spot (DBS) was collected for laboratory testing.

However, since the effectiveness of RACD is limited by the low sensitivity of point-of-care tests to detect low-density chronic infections that perpetuate malaria transmission, other approaches may be more effective. Objectives: This cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in a low endemic setting to evaluate the impact of two reactive focal malaria interventions - reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA) and reactive focal vector control (RAVC). The objectives were to: Evaluate the effectiveness of rfMDA, RAVC, and their combination to decrease malaria transmission Evaluate the safety of rfMDA and RAVC, alone and in combination Methodology: Geographic Location/Study Sites: Zambezi Region, Namibia Dates of Data Collection: January 2017-December 2017 Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled open label two-by-two factorial design trial Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study intervention are shown below: Study Arms: Fifty-six census enumeration area (EA) clusters were randomized to: 1) RACD or rfMDA, and 2) RAVC or no RAVC. RACD: rapid diagnostic testing and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) rfMDA: presumptive treatment with AL RAVC: indoor residual spraying using pirimiphos-methyl Data Collection: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting the parasite reservoir in humans (rfMDA versus RACD), in mosquitos (RAVC versus no RAVC), and in both humans and mosquitoes (rfMDA plus RAVC versus RACD only) on the primary outcome of cluster-level cumulative incidence of locally acquired malaria cases, an intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Interventions were administered to the target population within 500 meters of an index case, as randomized. Index cases were defined as passively detected malaria cases that were confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy, irrespective of origin (e.g. local or imported), who were confirmed to reside in or have stayed at least one night in study EA in the previous four weeks. Data on malaria incidence and epidemiological data such as demographics, residence location, travel history, and malaria prevention behavior were collected. Field teams aimed to visit the index case household and eligible neighboring households within seven days but up to five weeks from the report of an index case, prioritizing households that were closest to the index case. To cover â‰¥80% of individuals or households within 500 meters of index cases, field teams aimed to deliver RACD or rfMDA to at least 25 individuals and RAVC (if indicated) to at least 7 households. Epidemiological data were collected on password secured tablets with pre-coded questionnaires programmed in Open Data Kit (ODK version 1.23.3). Tablet data was uploaded to a secure, firewall- and password-protected server. During the RACD intervention and during the endline cross-sectional survey, consenting individuals received malaria RDT testing and a dried blood spot (DBS) was collected for laboratory testing.

RACD: rapid diagnostic testing and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) rfMDA: presumptive treatment with AL RAVC: indoor residual spraying using pirimiphos-methyl Data Collection: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting the parasite reservoir in humans (rfMDA versus RACD), in mosquitos (RAVC versus no RAVC), and in both humans and mosquitoes (rfMDA plus RAVC versus RACD only) on the primary outcome of cluster-level cumulative incidence of locally acquired malaria cases, an intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Interventions were administered to the target population within 500 meters of an index case, as randomized. Index cases were defined as passively detected malaria cases that were confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy, irrespective of origin (e.g. local or imported), who were confirmed to reside in or have stayed at least one night in study EA in the previous four weeks. Data on malaria incidence and epidemiological data such as demographics, residence location, travel history, and malaria prevention behavior were collected. Field teams aimed to visit the index case household and eligible neighboring households within seven days but up to five weeks from the report of an index case, prioritizing households that were closest to the index case. To cover â‰¥80% of individuals or households within 500 meters of index cases, field teams aimed to deliver RACD or rfMDA to at least 25 individuals and RAVC (if indicated) to at least 7 households. Epidemiological data were collected on password secured tablets with pre-coded questionnaires programmed in Open Data Kit (ODK version 1.23.3). Tablet data was uploaded to a secure, firewall- and password-protected server. During the RACD intervention and during the endline cross-sectional survey, consenting individuals received malaria RDT testing and a dried blood spot (DBS) was collected for laboratory testing.

25	S-EPMC2782860	OmicsDI	Selection of parasites with diminished drug susceptibility by amodiaquine-containing antimalarial regimens in Uganda.	Amodiaquine (AQ) is paired with artesunate (AS) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in recommended antimalarial regimens. It is unclear how readily AQ resistance will be selected with combination chemotherapy.We collected 61 Plasmodium falciparum samples from a cohort of Ugandan children randomized for treatment with AQ-SP, AS-AQ, or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for uncomplicated malaria. In vitro susceptibility to monodesethylamodiaquine (MDAQ) was measured with a histidine-rich protein 2-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and potential resistance-mediating polymorphisms in pfmdr1 were evaluated.Parasites collected from patients treated with AQ-SP or AS-AQ within the prior 12 weeks were less susceptible to MDAQ (n = 18; mean of the median inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], 62.9 nmol/L; range, 12.7-158.3 nmol/L) than were parasites from those not treated within 12 weeks (n = 43; mean IC(50), 37.5 nmol/L; range, 6.3-184.7 nmol/L; P=.009) or only from those patients in the treatment arm that did not receive AQ (n = 12; mean IC(50), 28.8 nmol/L; range, 6.3-121.8 nmol/L; P = .004). The proportion of strains with polymorphisms expected to mediate diminished response to AQ (pfmdr1 86Y and 1246Y) increased after AQ therapy, although differences were not statistically significant.Prior therapy selected for diminished response to MDAQ, which suggests that AQ-containing regimens may rapidly lose efficacy in Africa. The mechanism of diminished MDAQ response is not fully explained by known mutations in pfmdr1.

27	S-EPMC5123166	OmicsDI	Facial Dystonia with Facial Grimacing and Vertical Gaze Palsy with "Round the Houses" Sign in a 29-Year-Old Woman.	A 29-year-old woman developed progressive dysarthria and coordination problems from the age of 15. Examination showed dysarthria, facial dystonia, bibrachial dystonia, hyperreflexia, ataxia, and emotional incontinence. Downward supranuclear gaze palsy was prominent with a "Round the Houses" sign. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and medulla, electroneurography, and cerebrospinal fluid were normal. A computed tomography scan showed hepatosplenomegaly. This combination of progressive neurological symptoms together with hepatosplenomegaly was suggestive of inborn error of metabolism. A bone marrow biopsy showed an increased number of macrophages with foamy content, highly suggestive of lysosomal disease. Plasmatic chitotriosidase activity and CCL18 were increased. Genetic testing showed heterozygosis for the variation c.1070C?T (p.Ser357Leu) and c.1843?T (Arg615Cys), confirming the diagnosis of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). The "Round the Houses" sign has only been described in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). This sign is described as an inability to produce pure vertical saccades along the midline and instead moving the eyes in a lateral arc to accomplish the movement. The observation of this sign in a patient with NPC indicates that this bedside finding is not specific for PSP, but a sign of medial longitudinal fasciculus dysfunction. The presence of facial dystonia with facial grimacing together with supranuclear gaze palsy is highly characteristic and useful for the diagnosis of NPC. NPC is an important underdiagnosed condition, given the availability of treatment and a mean diagnostic delay of 6 years.

27	S-EPMC5123166	OmicsDI	Facial Dystonia with Facial Grimacing and Vertical Gaze Palsy with "Round the Houses" Sign in a 29-Year-Old Woman.	A 29-year-old woman developed progressive dysarthria and coordination problems from the age of 15. Examination showed dysarthria, facial dystonia, bibrachial dystonia, hyperreflexia, ataxia, and emotional incontinence. Downward supranuclear gaze palsy was prominent with a "Round the Houses" sign. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and medulla, electroneurography, and cerebrospinal fluid were normal. A computed tomography scan showed hepatosplenomegaly. This combination of progressive neurological symptoms together with hepatosplenomegaly was suggestive of inborn error of metabolism. A bone marrow biopsy showed an increased number of macrophages with foamy content, highly suggestive of lysosomal disease. Plasmatic chitotriosidase activity and CCL18 were increased. Genetic testing showed heterozygosis for the variation c.1070C?T (p.Ser357Leu) and c.1843?T (Arg615Cys), confirming the diagnosis of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). The "Round the Houses" sign has only been described in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). This sign is described as an inability to produce pure vertical saccades along the midline and instead moving the eyes in a lateral arc to accomplish the movement. The observation of this sign in a patient with NPC indicates that this bedside finding is not specific for PSP, but a sign of medial longitudinal fasciculus dysfunction. The presence of facial dystonia with facial grimacing together with supranuclear gaze palsy is highly characteristic and useful for the diagnosis of NPC. NPC is an important underdiagnosed condition, given the availability of treatment and a mean diagnostic delay of 6 years.

30	E-GEOD-61150	OmicsDI	Aberrant DNA methylation in rhabdomyosarcoma	Many pediatric malignancies are embryonal in nature, and one hypothesis for the origin of embryonal tumors is that they arise from a defect in differentiation, either by an inability to terminally differentiate or a reversion to a pluripotent state. There is emerging evidence that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the transition from embryonic stem cell to a more committed cell fate, utilizing both de novo DNA methylation and poised â€˜bivalentâ€™ chromatin domains (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) to abolish pluripotency and gain lineage- and cell-type-specific characteristics as a cell differentiates. Thus inappropriate epigenetic silencing by aberrant DNA methylation of bivalent genes required for differentiation could lead to the uncontrolled cell growth observed in cancer. Our broad hypothesis is that aberrant DNA methylation in cancer is targeted to a non-random subset of critical pathways used in normal development. This dysregulation of the normal epigenetic program used in development promotes cellular proliferation and provides a mechanism to block differentiation in pediatric cancers, such as rhabdomyosarcoma.

Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 (LH2171) has been reported to ameliorate the development of autoimmune diseases, such as collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalitis in mice and inhibit interleukin (IL)-6 production in antigen-presenting cells in vitro. Regulation of cytokine production by antigen-presenting cells might be critical for the anti-inflammatory function of LH2171 in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanism and contributing components of LH2171-mediated inhibition of IL-6 production are unclear. Here, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of LH2171 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, as a model of antigen-presenting cells, necessary for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. LH2171 significantly reduced LPS-induced expression and secretion of IL-6 and IL-1? cytokines. It also inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases (NF-?B/MAPKs). Moreover, LH2171 induced gene expression of several negative regulators of NF-?B/MAPKs. Among these regulators, A20 was strongly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels upon LH2171 treatment. The cell wall fraction of LH2171 also demonstrated a similar increase in A20 gene expression and exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. These results suggest that the cell wall may be one of the anti-inflammatory components of LH2171. Since cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effect of LH2171 was mediated by TLR2 signaling. Specifically, LH2171-mediated IL-6 suppression and A20 upregulation in wild-type macrophages were reversed and significantly reduced in TLR2 knock-out macrophages. These results suggest that LH2171 induces A20 expression via TLR2 signaling, inhibiting the activation of NF-?B/MAPKs and cytokine production in antigen-presenting cells. This might contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of LH2171 on autoimmune diseases.

Carbapenem-resistant determinants and their surrounding genetic structure were studied in Acinetobacter spp. from neonatal sepsis cases collected over 7 years at a tertiary care hospital. Acinetobacter spp. (n = 68) were identified by ARDRA followed by susceptibility tests. Oxacillinases, metallo-?-lactamases (MBLs), extended-spectrum ?-lactamases and AmpCs, were detected phenotypically and/or by PCR followed by DNA sequencing. Transconjugants possessing the bla NDM-1(New Delhi metallo-?-lactamase) underwent further analysis for plasmids, integrons and associated genes. Genetic environment of the carbapenemases were studied by PCR mapping and DNA sequencing. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for sepsis caused by NDM-1-harboring organisms. A. baumannii (72%) was the predominant species followed by A. calcoaceticus (10%), A. lwoffii (6%), A. nosocomialis (3%), A. junni (3%), A. variabilis (3%), A. haemolyticus (2%), and 14TU (2%). Fifty six percent of the isolates were meropenem-resistant. Oxacillinases present were OXA-23-like, OXA-58-like and OXA-51-like, predominately in A. baumannii. NDM-1 was the dominant MBL (22%) across different Acinetobacter spp. Isolates harboring NDM-1 also possessed bla (VIM-2, PER-1, VEB-2, CTX-M-15), armA, aac(6')Ib, aac(6')Ib-cr genes. bla NDM-1was organized in a composite transposon between two copies of ISAba125 in the isolates irrespective of the species. Further, OXA-23-like gene and OXA-58-like genes were linked with ISAba1 and ISAba3 respectively. Isolates were clonally diverse. Integrons were variable in sequence but not associated with carbapenem resistance. Most commonly found genes in the 5' and 3'conserved segment were aminoglycoside resistance genes (aadB, aadA2, aac4'), non-enzymatic chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA1g) and ADP-ribosylation genes (arr2, arr3).

Transconjugants possessing the bla NDM-1(New Delhi metallo-?-lactamase) underwent further analysis for plasmids, integrons and associated genes. Genetic environment of the carbapenemases were studied by PCR mapping and DNA sequencing. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for sepsis caused by NDM-1-harboring organisms. A. baumannii (72%) was the predominant species followed by A. calcoaceticus (10%), A. lwoffii (6%), A. nosocomialis (3%), A. junni (3%), A. variabilis (3%), A. haemolyticus (2%), and 14TU (2%). Fifty six percent of the isolates were meropenem-resistant. Oxacillinases present were OXA-23-like, OXA-58-like and OXA-51-like, predominately in A. baumannii. NDM-1 was the dominant MBL (22%) across different Acinetobacter spp. Isolates harboring NDM-1 also possessed bla (VIM-2, PER-1, VEB-2, CTX-M-15), armA, aac(6')Ib, aac(6')Ib-cr genes. bla NDM-1was organized in a composite transposon between two copies of ISAba125 in the isolates irrespective of the species. Further, OXA-23-like gene and OXA-58-like genes were linked with ISAba1 and ISAba3 respectively. Isolates were clonally diverse. Integrons were variable in sequence but not associated with carbapenem resistance. Most commonly found genes in the 5' and 3'conserved segment were aminoglycoside resistance genes (aadB, aadA2, aac4'), non-enzymatic chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA1g) and ADP-ribosylation genes (arr2, arr3). Outborn neonates had a significantly higher incidence of sepsis due to NDM-1 harboring isolates than their inborn counterparts. This study demonstrates the significance of both A. baumannii and other species of Acinetobacter in cases of neonatal sepsis over an extended period. Oxacillinases and bla NDM-1 are the major contributors to carbapenem resistance. The dissemination of the bla NDM-1 is likely linked to Tn125 in diverse clones of the isolates.

40	S-EPMC4990225	OmicsDI	Regions of variable DNA methylation in human placenta associated with newborn neurobehavior.	The placenta regulates the in utero environment and functionally impacts fetal development. Candidate gene studies identified variation in placental DNA methylation is associated with newborn neurologic and behavioral outcomes including movement quality, lethargic behavior, attention, and arousal. We sought to identify novel regions of variable DNA methylation associated with newborn attention, lethargy, quality of movement, and arousal by performing an epigenome-wide association study in 335 infants from a US birth cohort. Methylation status was quantified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array and associations to newborn outcomes assessed by the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) were identified while incorporating established bioinformatics algorithms to control for confounding by cell type composition. Methylation of CpGs within FHIT (cg15970800) and ANKRD11 (cg16710656) demonstrated genome-wide significance (P < 1.8 Ã— 10(-7)) in specific associations with infant attention. CpGs whose differential methylation was associated with all 4 neurobehavioral outcomes were common to 50 genes involved in biological processes relating to cellular adhesion and nervous system development. Comprehensive methylation profiling identified relationships between methylation of FHIT and ANKRD11, which have been previously linked to neurodevelopment and behavioral outcomes in genetic association studies. Subtle changes in DNA methylation of these genes within the placenta may impact normal variation of a newborn's ability to alter and track visual and auditory stimuli. Gene ontology analysis suggested that those genes with variable methylation related to these outcomes are over-represented in biological pathways involved in brain development and placental physiology, supportive of our hypothesis for a key role of the placenta in neurobehavioral outcomes.

Extracellular matrix (ECM) is the protein- and polysaccharide-rich backbone of bacterial biofilms that provides a defensive barrier in clinical, environmental and industrial settings. Understanding the dynamics of biofilm formation in native environments has been hindered by a lack of research tools. Here we report a method for simultaneous, real-time, in situ detection and differentiation of the Salmonella ECM components curli and cellulose, using non-toxic, luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs). These flexible conjugated polymers emit a conformation-dependent fluorescence spectrum, which we use to kinetically define extracellular appearance of curli fibres and cellulose polysaccharides during bacterial growth. The scope of this technique is demonstrated by defining biofilm morphotypes of Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium, and their isogenic mutants in liquid culture and on solid media, and by visualising the ECM components in native biofilms. Our reported use of LCOs across a number of platforms, including intracellular cellulose production in eukaryotic cells and in infected tissues, demonstrates the versatility of this optotracing technology, and its ability to redefine biofilm research.

47	S-EPMC3426698	OmicsDI	Identification of soil bacteria susceptible to TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles.	Because soil is expected to be a major sink for engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) released to the environment, the effects of ENPs on soil processes and the organisms that carry them out should be understood. DNA-based fingerprinting analyses have shown that ENPs alter soil bacterial communities, but specific taxon changes remain unknown. We used bar-coded pyrosequencing to explore the responses of diverse bacterial taxa to two widely used ENPs, nano-TiO(2) and nano-ZnO, at various doses (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg g(-1) soil for TiO(2); 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg g(-1) soil for ZnO) in incubated soil microcosms. These ENPs significantly altered the bacterial communities in a dose-dependent manner, with some taxa increasing as a proportion of the community, but more taxa decreasing, indicating that effects mostly reduced diversity. Some of the declining taxa are known to be associated with nitrogen fixation (Rhizobiales, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and Bradyrhizobium) and methane oxidation (Methylobacteriaceae), while some positively impacted taxa are known to be associated with the decomposition of recalcitrant organic pollutants (Sphingomonadaceae) and biopolymers including protein (Streptomycetaceae and Streptomyces), indicating potential consequences to ecosystem-scale processes. The latter was suggested by a positive correlation between protease activity and the relative abundance of Streptomycetaceae (R = 0.49, P = 0.000) and Streptomyces (R = 0.47, P = 0.000).

Because soil is expected to be a major sink for engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) released to the environment, the effects of ENPs on soil processes and the organisms that carry them out should be understood. DNA-based fingerprinting analyses have shown that ENPs alter soil bacterial communities, but specific taxon changes remain unknown. We used bar-coded pyrosequencing to explore the responses of diverse bacterial taxa to two widely used ENPs, nano-TiO(2) and nano-ZnO, at various doses (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg g(-1) soil for TiO(2); 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg g(-1) soil for ZnO) in incubated soil microcosms.

Here, we present single-cell transcriptomic analysis of >100,000 viral antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from 40 COVID-19 patients. In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper cells and cytotoxic T helper (TH) cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2 and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (TREG). Importantly, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a strong cytotoxic TFH response was observed early in the illness, which correlated negatively with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Polyfunctional TH1 and TH17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells compared to influenza-reactive CD4+ T cells. Together, our analyses provide insights into the gene expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in distinct disease severities.

However, our knowledge on in vivo persistence of transfused Treg is limited. Whether Treg transfusion leads to notable changes in the overall Treg repertoire and or whether longevity of Treg in the periphery is restricted to certain clones is unknown. Here we use T cell receptor alpha chain sequencing (TCRÎ±-NGS) to monitor changes in the repertoire of Treg upon polyclonal expansion and after subsequent adoptive transfer. We applied TCRÎ±-NGS to samples from two patients with chronic GvHD who received comparable doses of stem cell donor derived expanded Treg. We found that in vitro polyclonal expansion led to notable repertoire changes in vitro and that Treg cell therapy considerably altered peripheral Treg repertoire toward that of the infused cell product, to different degrees in each patient. Clonal changes in the peripheral blood were transient and correlated well with the clinical parameters. We suggest that T cell clonotype analyses using TCR sequencing should be considered as a means to monitor longevity and fate of adoptively transferred T cells.

87	ZENODO_4310163	Zenodo	Mating under climate change: impact of simulated heatwaves on the reproduction of model pollinators (Dataset)	Climate change is related to an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events such as heatwaves. It is well established that such events may worsen the current worldwide biodiversity decline. In many organisms, heat stress is associated with direct physiological perturbations and could lead to a decrease of fitness. In contrast to endotherms, heat stress resistance has been poorly investigated in heterotherms; especially in insects, in which the internal physiological mechanisms available to regulate body temperature are almost negligible making them sensitive to extreme temperature variations. Wild bees are crucial pollinators for wild plants and crops. Among them, bumblebees are experiencing a strong decline across the world. Therefore, the ongoing global decline of these insect pollinators partly due to climate change could cause major economic issues. Here, we assess how simulated heatwaves impact fertility and attractiveness (key parameters of sustainability) of bumblebee males. We used three model species: Bombus terrestris, a widespread and warm-adapted species, B. magnus and B. jonellus, two declining and cold-adapted species. We highlight that heat shock (40Â°C) negatively affects sperm viability and sperm DNA integrity only in the two cold-adapted species. Heat shock can also impact the structure of cephalic labial glands and the production of pheromones only in the declining species. The specific disruption in key reproductive traits we identify following simulated heatwave conditions could provide one important mechanistic explanation for why some pollinators are in decline through climate change.

94	ZENODO_7056381	Zenodo	Tidy' and 'messy' management alters natural enemy communities and pest control in urban agroecosystems	Agroecosystem management influences ecological interactions that underpin ecosystem services. In human-centered systems, people's values and preferences influence management decisions. For example, aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' agroecosystems may remove vegetation complexity with potential negative impacts on beneficial associated biodiversity and ecosystem function. This may produce trade-offs in aesthetic- versus production-based management for ecosystem service provision. Yet, it is unclear how such preferences influence the ecology of small-scale urban agroecosystems, where aesthetic preferences for 'tidiness' are prominent among some gardener demographics. We used urban community gardens as a model system to experimentally test how aesthetic preferences for a 'tidy garden' versus a 'messy garden' influence insect pests, natural enemies, and pest control services. We manipulated gardens by mimicking a popular 'tidy' management practice â€“ woodchip mulching â€“ on the one hand, and simulating 'messy' gardens by adding 'weedy' plants to pathways on the other hand. Then, we measured for differences in natural enemy biodiversity (abundance, richness, community composition), and sentinel pest removal as a result of the tidy/messy manipulation. In addition, we measured vegetation and ground cover features of the garden system as measures of practices already in place. The tidy/messy manipulation did not significantly alter natural enemy or herbivore abundance within garden plots. The manipulation did, however, produce different compositions of natural enemy communities before and after the manipulation. Furthermore, the manipulation did affect short term gains and losses in predation services: the messy manipulation immediately lowered aphid pest removal compared to the tidy manipulation, while mulch already present in the system lowered Lepidoptera egg removal. Aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' green spaces often dominate urban landscapes. Yet, in urban food production systems, such aesthetic values and management preferences may create a fundamental tension in the provision of ecosystem services that support sustainable urban agriculture. Though human preferences may be hard to change, we suggest that gardeners allow some 'messiness' in their garden plots as a "lazy gardener" approach may promote particular natural enemy assemblages and may have no downsides to natural predation services.

97	ZENODO_4990807	Zenodo	Data from: A low-cost solution for documenting distribution and abundance of endangered marine fauna and impacts from fisheries	Fisheries bycatch is a widespread and serious issue that leads to declines of many important and threatened marine species. However, documenting the distribution, abundance, population trends and threats to sparse populations of marine species is often beyond the capacity of developing countries because such work is complex, time consuming and often extremely expensive. We have developed a flexible tool to document spatial distribution and population trends for dugongs and other marine species in the form of an interview questionnaire supported by a structured data upload sheet and a comprehensive project manual. Recognising the effort invested in getting interviewers to remote locations, the questionnaire is comprehensive, but low cost. The questionnaire has already been deployed in 18 countries across the Indo-Pacific region. Project teams spent an average of USD 5,000 per country and obtained large data sets on dugong distribution, trends, catch and bycatch, and threat overlaps. Findings indicated that >50% of respondents had never seen dugongs and that 20% had seen a single dugong in their lifetimes despite living and fishing in areas of known or suspected dugong habitat, suggesting that dugongs occured in low numbers. Only 3% of respondents had seen mother and calf pairs, indicative of low reproductive output. Dugong hunting was still common in several countries. Gillnets and hook and line were the most common fishing gears, with the greatest mortality caused by gillnets. The questionnaire has also been used to study manatees in the Caribbean, coastal cetaceans along the eastern Gulf of Thailand and western Peninsular Malaysia, and river dolphins in Peru. This questionnaire is a powerful tool for studying distribution and relative abundance for marine species and fishery pressures, and determining potential conservation hotspot areas. We provide the questionnaire and supporting documents for open-access use by the scientific and conservation communities.

The questionnaire has also been used to study manatees in the Caribbean, coastal cetaceans along the eastern Gulf of Thailand and western Peninsular Malaysia, and river dolphins in Peru. This questionnaire is a powerful tool for studying distribution and relative abundance for marine species and fishery pressures, and determining potential conservation hotspot areas. We provide the questionnaire and supporting documents for open-access use by the scientific and conservation communities.

97	ZENODO_4990807	Zenodo	Data from: A low-cost solution for documenting distribution and abundance of endangered marine fauna and impacts from fisheries	Fisheries bycatch is a widespread and serious issue that leads to declines of many important and threatened marine species. However, documenting the distribution, abundance, population trends and threats to sparse populations of marine species is often beyond the capacity of developing countries because such work is complex, time consuming and often extremely expensive. We have developed a flexible tool to document spatial distribution and population trends for dugongs and other marine species in the form of an interview questionnaire supported by a structured data upload sheet and a comprehensive project manual. Recognising the effort invested in getting interviewers to remote locations, the questionnaire is comprehensive, but low cost. The questionnaire has already been deployed in 18 countries across the Indo-Pacific region. Project teams spent an average of USD 5,000 per country and obtained large data sets on dugong distribution, trends, catch and bycatch, and threat overlaps. Findings indicated that >50% of respondents had never seen dugongs and that 20% had seen a single dugong in their lifetimes despite living and fishing in areas of known or suspected dugong habitat, suggesting that dugongs occured in low numbers. Only 3% of respondents had seen mother and calf pairs, indicative of low reproductive output. Dugong hunting was still common in several countries. Gillnets and hook and line were the most common fishing gears, with the greatest mortality caused by gillnets.
