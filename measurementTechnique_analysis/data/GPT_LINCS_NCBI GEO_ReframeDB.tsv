lds-1013	AZD7762 KINOMEscan	The KINOMEscan assay platform is based on a competition binding assay that is run for a compound of interest against each of a panel of 317 to 456 kinases. The assay has three components: a kinase-tagged phage, a test compound, and an immobilized ligand that the compound competes with to displace the kinase. The amount of kinase bound to the immobilized ligand is determined using quantitative PCR of the DNA tag.  Results for each kinase are reported as "Percent of control", where the control is DMSO and where a 100% result means no inhibition of kinase binding to the ligand in the presence of the compound, and where low percent results mean strong inhibition. The KINOMEscan data are presented graphically on TREEspot Kinase Dendrograms (http://www.kinomescan.com/Tools---Resources/Study-Reports---Data-Analysis).  For this study, HMS LINCS investigators have graphed results for kinases classified as 35 "percent of control" (in the presence of the compound, the kinase is 35% as active for binding ligand in the presence of DMSO), 5 "percent of control" and 1 "percent of control". 	gpt-3.5-turbo	{'name': 'KINOMEscan kinase-small molecule binding assay', 'description': 'Biochemical'}	['Competition binding assay', 'KinomeScan assay', 'Quantitative PCR', 'Bioinformatics analysis']

Some of the adventitial infiltrates formed large clusters of various immune cells including T cells, B cells (centrocytes, follicular mantle cells), dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, and plasma cells with preferential formation in the suprarenal portion of the abdominal aorta. These data demonstrated that the immune lineage cell composition of atherosclerotic lesions and adventitia were distinct: The macrophage-foam cell-, T cell-, and SMC-dominated cell composition of atherosclerosis lesions versus the presence of immune cells capable of carrying out antigen-dependent T cell-driven humoral immune responses in the adventitia also indicated that immune reactions carried out in lesions or the adventitia are fundamentaly different. To distinguish between immunity-regulating genes in atherosclerosis lesions versus the adventitia, a combination of microarray profiling and laser capture microdissection was used. Stringent filters revealed 1163 differentially up-regulated probesets in apoE-/- mouse aortae at 78 weeks (w) versus 6 w. A fuzzy c-means cluster algorythm identified 2 clusters that significantly differed in their slope angles between time points: An apparent atherosclerosis cluster consisted of 771 probesets and an apparent adventitia cluster consisted of 392 probesets. Up-regulated genes at 32 w mirrored the influx of monocyte/macrophages into intima lesions whereas genes up-regulated between 32-78 w mirrored adventitial inflammation. To segregate both clusters into separate gene ontology (GO) molecular function groups, we determined statistically significant up-regulation (unpaired Student t-test; p < 0.05) between 6-32 w for the atherosclerosis cluster and between 32-78 w for the adventitia cluster. Among others, GO molecular function terms cytokine activity, cytokine binding, and immunoglobulin binding in the atherosclerosis cluster and cytokine activity, chemokine receptor activity, and antigen binding in the ATLO cluster suggested candidate genes in relation to inflammation triggered by macrophages or adventitia infiltration, respectively. Among other prototype atherosclerosis genes such as Itgax (complement receptor 4), Cd68, Lysz (lysozyme), Vcam1, and Icam1, the atherosclerosis cluster showed markedly overrepresented prototype macrophage/foam cell genes regulating inflammation in cytokine activity (GO: 0005125): Spp1 (osteopontin) and Il6; in cytokine binding (GO: 0019955) Cd74, Il10rb, Ccr2, and Ccr5; and in immunoglobulin binding (GO: 00119865) the proinflammatory galactose-binding lectin Lgals3, as well as genes in scavenger receptor activity and lipid transporter activity. By contrast, the adventitia cluster showed overrepresented genes regulating B cell recruitment, B cell maturation, germinal center formation, and autoimmunity in cytokine activity including Cxcl13, Ccl21, and Ltb, in CXC chemokine receptor activity the secondary lymphoid organ counterreceptor of CXCL13 Blr1 (also known as Cxcr5), Cxcr3, and Cxcr6; and in antigen binding several histocompatibility-2 loci and various markedly expressed immunoglobulin genes. As embryonic lymph node development and tertiary lymphoid organ neogenesis share common features signal intensities of genes specifying the GO molecular function term lymph node development (GO: 0048535) were examined in arrays prepared from wild-type and apoE-/- aortae. These results showed that Id2, Nfkb1, and Ltbr were constitutively expressed at significant levels in aortae of both mouse genotypes whereas other genes including Lta, Ltb, Glycam1, and the two lymphorganogenic genes Cxcl13 and Ccl21 were induced at 78 w in apoE-deficient aortae only. Thus, genes expressed by macrophage-foam cells and genes regulating ATLO neogenesis, embryonic lymph node development, or B cell maturation were constitutively expressed in the arterial wall in both genotypes or emerged in a stepwise fashion at 32 w and 78 w. To verify microarray signal intensity data, separate aortae extracts were examined by quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) analyses of wild-type and apoE-deficient mice at 32 and 78 w. These data showed that array signal values accurately reflected gene transcripts. Cell lineage analyses of the adventitial infiltrate and kinetic aorta microarray- and QRT-PCR analyses thus provided circumstantial evidence that immune responses in atherosclerosis intima lesions and the adventitia were distinct. To examine this possibility further, we selected areas of the abdominal aorta burdened with advanced lesions and separated lesions and corresponding adventitial infiltrates of 78 w old apoE-deficient mice by laser dissection microscopy. In addition, adventitiae of aorta segments that were not associated with adjacent lesions and adventitiae of wild-type mice were prepared. Consistent with the lack of a major adventitial leukocyte infiltration, wild-type adventitiae showed gene expression levels that were similar to lesion-free adventitiae of apoE-deficient mice indicating that atherosclerotic lesions directly affected adventitial inflammation in a segmental fashion. Stringent filter criteria identified genes that were differentially expressed in adventitiae and atherosclerotic lesions. Statistical analyses of overrepresented genes in GO molecular function or biological process groups were particularly instructive in cytokine activity, cytokine binding, antigen processing and presentation as well as in lymph node development. Thus, adventitiae in aorta segments with associated atherosclerotic lesions in cytokine activity showed overrepresentation of genes known to be associated with tertiary lymphoid organ formation including Cxcl13, Ccl21, and Ltb, whereas atherosclerotic lesions showed overrepresentation of prototype atherosclerosis-associated genes Ssp1 (osteopontin), Bmp4 (bone morphogenic protein 4), and Cxc3cl1 (fractalkine); in cytokine binding adventitiae showed overrepresentation of receptors implicated in B cell immunity and autoimmunity including Brl1 (counterreceptor for CXCL13), Ccr7, Tnfrsf4, and Cxcr3 whereas lesions showed overrepresentation of inflammatory mediator receptors including Tnfrs1b, Tgfbr1, and Il7r; moreover, in antigen processing and presentation, adventitiae showed overrepresentation of several histocompatibility loci; additional adventitial gene expression overrepresentations were observed in lymph node development (Fas, SpiB, Ltb, Flt3) whereas lesions showed expression of prototype macrophage genes including Tlr4, Tgfb1, and Tgfb2.  These data provide comprehensive topographical transcriptome information in adventitial tissue adjacent to atherosclerotic lesions versus lesions and are expected to form the basis for future cell lineage expression analyses using single cell detection methodology including ISH.Keywords: Atherosclerosis, aorta transcriptomes, adventitia, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, immune response, tertiary lymphoid organogenesis Wild-type and apoE-deficient mice on the C57BL/6J genetic background were maintained on a standard mouse chow. Total aortae were removed at the age of 6 (n=3), 32 (n=3), or 78 (n=3) w and microarrays were prepared from total RNA extracts or extracts of atherosclerotic lesions and adventitiae obtained by the use of a laser dissection microscope.	gpt-3.5-turbo	[{'name': 'Expression profiling by array'}]	['Microarray profiling', 'Laser capture microdissection', 'Fuzzy c-means cluster algorithm', 'Unpaired Student t-test', 'Quantitative RT-PCR', 'Laser dissection microscopy', 'Single cell detection methodology', 'In situ hybridization (ISH)']

gse100002	Molecular and functional sex differences of noradrenergic neurons in the mouse locus coeruleus [Affymetrix]	Preclinical work has long focused only on male animals, even though sexual divergence in both baseline behaviors and drug responses clearly impact treatment outcomes in patients.  Psychiatric disorders are notably divergent, with males showing higher prevalence of ADHD and ASD, and females GAD and MDD. This divergence is reflected in quantitative differences in subclincal behaviors. The Noradrenergic neurotransmitter system is targeted by many psychiatric drugs, but is relatively uncharacterized at a molecular level.  We developed a mouse to profile these neurons, defining their both a baseline transcriptome, including druggable receptors, and their molecular  response to stimulation.  We also discovered a remarkable sexual divergence in their gene expression, including functionally increased expression of the EP3 receptor in females – a difference that can be used to modulate stress-induced anxiety in a sex specific manner.  These findings underscore the need to conduct preclinical studies in a manner balanced for sex, and suggest that baseline differences in noradrenergic neurons could underlay sexually divergent behaviors.

gse100007	Widespread translational remodeling during human neuronal differentiation	Faithful cellular differentiation requires precise coordination of changes in gene expression. However, the relative contributions of transcriptional and translational regulation during human cellular differentiation are unclear. Here, we induced forebrain neuronal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and characterized genome-wide RNA and translation levels during neurogenesis. We find that thousands of genes change at the translation level across differentiation without a corresponding change in RNA level. Specifically, we identify mTOR complex 1 signaling as a key driver for elevated translation of translation-related genes in hESCs. In contrast, translational repression in active neurons is mediated by transcript 3′ UTRs, through regulatory sequences. Together, our findings identify a functional role for the dramatic 3′ UTR extensions that occur during brain development, and provide insights to interpret genetic variants in post-transcriptional control factors that influence neurodevelopmental disorders and diseases. Forebrain neural cultures differentiated from human embryonic stem cells were isolated and cellular RNA, polysomal RNA, and ribosome protected footprints were deep sequenced.	gpt-3.5-turbo	[{'name': 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing'}, {'name': 'Other'}]	['Deep sequencing', 'Ribosome profiling']
gse100009	The ZZ-type zinc finger of ZZZ3 modulates the ATAC complex-mediated histone acetylation and gene activation	Recognition of post-translational modifications on histones by epigenetic readers is a fundamental mechanism for the regulation of chromatin and transcription. Compared to the large number of readers that recognize histone methylation, only a few acetyllysine readers have been identified, including bromodomain, YEATS, and double plant homeodomain zinc finger (DPF). Here, we report the identification of a novel reader of histone H3, the ZZ-type zinc finger (ZZ) domain of ZZZ3, a subunit of the Ada-Two-A Containing (ATAC) histone acetyltransferase complex. The solution NMR structure of the ZZ in complex with the H3 peptide reveals a unique histone-binding mechanism involving caging of the N-terminal Alanine 1 of histone H3 in an acidic cavity of the ZZ domain. Importantly, acetylation on Lysine 4 of H3 (H3K4ac) enhances the binding, and in cells, ZZZ3 colocalizes with H3K4ac across the genome. The recognition of histone acetylation by ZZ is essential for chromatin occupancy of ZZZ3 and functions of the ATAC complex. Depletion of ZZZ3 or disruption of the ZZ-H3 interaction dampens ATAC dependent promoter histone H3K9 acetylation and the expression of ribosomal protein encoding genes. Overall, our study identifies the ZZ domain of ZZZ3 as a novel epigenetic reader that links the GCN5/ATAC complex to histone acetylation.

gse10001	Gene expression profiling in NCoR deficient mouse livers	The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) has been proposed to regulate target genes in the absence of triiodothyronine (T3), through the recruitment of the corepressors, NCoR and SMRT. NCoR and SMRT may thus play a key role in both hypothyroidism and resistance to thyroid hormone, though this has never been tested in vivo. To accomplish this we developed mice that express in the liver a NCoR protein (L-NCoR∆ID) that cannot interact with the TR. L-NCoR∆ID mice develop normally, however when made hypothyroid the repression of many positively regulated T3-target genes is abrogated, demonstrating that NCoR plays a specific and sufficient role in repression by the unliganded TR. Remarkably, in the euthyroid state, expression of many T3-targets are also upregulated in L-NCoR∆ID mice, demonstrating that NCoR also determines the magnitude of the response to T3 in euthyroid animals. While positive T3 targets were upregulated in L-NCoR∆ID mice in the hypo and euthyroid state there was less effect seen on negatively regulated T3 target genes. Thus, NCoR is a specific regulator of T3-action in vivo and mediates the activity of the unliganded TR. Furthermore, NCoR may play a key role in determining the differences in individual responses to similar levels of circulating T3.Keywords: NCoR, thyroid hormone signaling, mouse liver,  DNA Microarray To better assess the role of NCoR in positive and negative regulation we performed micorarray analysis of gene expression in the livers of euthyroid and hypothyroid control and L-NCoR∆ID mice.	gpt-3.5-turbo	[{'name': 'Expression profiling by array'}]	['Gene expression profiling', 'DNA Microarray', 'Microarray analysis']
gse100010	RNA-directed DNA methylation involves co-transcriptional small RNA-guided slicing of Pol V transcripts in Arabidopsis	Small RNAs regulate chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation and gene silencing across eukaryotic genomes. In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) requires 24-nucleotide (nt) small RNAs (siRNAs) that bind ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) and target genomic regions for silencing. It also requires non-coding RNAs transcribed by RNA POLYMERASE V (Pol V), although their function is largely unknown. We utilized a modified global nuclear run-on (GRO) protocol followed by deep sequencing to capture Pol V nascent transcripts genome-wide. We uncovered unique characteristics of Pol V RNAs, including a uracil (U) common at position 10. This uracil was complementary to the 5’ adenine found in many AGO4-bound 24-nt siRNAs and was eliminated in an siRNA-deficient mutant. This indicates co-transcriptional slicing of Pol V transcripts by AGO4-bound siRNAs. Pol V transcript slicing also required the elongation factor SPT5L. These results highlight a novel step in RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing, which is a conserved process in many eukaryotes. 24 GROseq and 4 ChIPseq samples.	gpt-3.5-turbo	[{'name': 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing'}, {'name': 'Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing'}]	['Global nuclear run-on (GRO)', 'Deep sequencing', 'ChIPseq']
gse100011	Ectopic application of the repressive histone modification H3K9me2 establishes postzygotic reproductive isolation in Arabidopsis thaliana	Hybrid seed lethality as a consequence of interspecies or interploidy hybridizations is a major mechanism of reproductive isolation in plants. This mechanism is manifested in the endosperm, a dosage sensitive tissue supporting embryo growth. Deregulated expression of imprinted genes like ADMETOS (ADM) underpin the interploidy hybridization barrier in Arabidopsis thaliana, however, the mechanisms of their action remained unknown. In this study we show that ADM interacts with the AT-hook domain protein AHL10 and the SET domain-containing SU(VAR)3-9 homolog SUVH9 and ectopically recruits the heterochromatic mark H3K9me2 to AT-rich transposable elements (TEs), causing deregulated expression of neighboring genes. Several hybrid incompatibility genes identified in Drosophila encode for heterochromatin-interacting proteins, which has led to the suggestion that hybrid incompatibilities evolve as consequence of interspecies divergence of selfish DNA elements and their regulation. Our data showing that imbalance of dosage-sensitive chromatin regulators underpins hybrid incompatibility in Arabidopsis strongly support this view, demonstrating that reproductive isolation as a consequence of epigenetic regulation of TEs is a conserved feature in animals and plants. 54 genome-wide ChIP sequencing libraries and 6 genome-wide cytosine methylation libraries.

Our purpose is to uncover novel human mutations and genes causing familial NOA and CC.  Methods: We performed whole-exome sequencing for two brothers with both NOA and CC from a consanguineous family.The proband was also carried out SNP array analysis. Mutation screening of TDRD7 was performed in another similar consanguineous family and 176 patients with azoospermia or CC alone and 520 healthy controls. Histological analysis was performed for the biopsied testicle sample in one patient, and knockout mice were constructed to verify the phenotype of the mutation in TDRD7.   Results: Two novel loss-of-function mutations (c.324_325insA (T110Nfs*30) and (c.688-689insA (p.Y230X), respectively) of TDRD7 were found in the affected patients from the two unrelated consanguineous families. Histological analysis demonstrated a lack of mature sperm in the male patient’s seminiferous tubules. The mutations were not detected in patients with CC or NOA alone. Mice with Tdrd7 gene disrupted at a similar position precisely replicated the human syndrome.   Conclusions: We identified TDRD7 causing CC as a new pathogenic gene for male azoospermia in human, with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.

reframedb_a00360	Screen for Acanthamoeba growth inhibitors using CellTiterGlo	Secondary Assay: Identification of growth inhibitors of Acanthamoeba castellanii via luminescence cell-based assay Purpose Acanthamoeba spp. are free-living amebae widely spread in the environment that can act as opportunistic pathogens and cause deadly human infections. Acanthamoeba spp. can enter either via respiratory tract or broken skin and invade the CNS, causing Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis (GAE), which is more common in immunosuppressed individuals. Acanthamoeba spp. can also cause amebic keratitis, a severe eye infection among contact lens wearers. In our screen we incubated the A. castellanii trophozoites with the compounds for 48 hours and assessed viability using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The antiparasitic activity is calculated based on the reduction of luminescence signal compared to the DMSO-treated controls.

reframedb_a00203	Screen in Luciferase-expressing E. histolytica protocol	This is a cell based phenotypic screen to find in the ReFRAME library compounds capable of inhibit growth of Entamoeba histolytica strain HM-I:IMSS. The parasite expresses luciferase. Decrease of luminescence signal compared to non-treated parasites will be related to growth inhibition. Purpose Amoebiasis is a neglected disease affecting millions of people worldwide with poor and considerably toxic treatment options. The parasite infects 500 million people annually and causes colitis and liver abscess in over 50 million people a year with an estimated 100,000 deaths, making it a leading cause of parasitic death in humans. In our assay, we identify small molecule inhibitors by measuring the viability of trophozoite-stage E. histolytica. Metronidazol is the standard of care for amoebiasis, and it is used as positive control. Activity is detected by reduction of luminescence signal compared to the negative control DMSO. Protocol Entamoeba histolytica HM-1: IMSS trophozoites stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct (CS-luc) are cultivated at 37? C in logaritimc phase. The library plates are be kept at -20?C until the day of the experiment, when they are left at RT for 24 hours before plating. The cells are harvest by icing and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The parasites are plated at 384 white plates pinned with the library drugs using a multidrop dispenser at a final volume of 100 uL/well with 3000 parasites per well. Plates are kept in anaerobic chamber (BD GasPaktm EZ) at 37? C. For the read out, plates are kept at RT for 40 min to equilibrate temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm, the media is aspirated using the ELX405 microplate washer in a aspiration setting. The reagent BrightGlo (Promega) is diluted 1:1 with 1X PBS and also equilibrated to RT. Passed the 40 min, 20 uL/well of the reagent is added to the plates with multidrop. They are read at Tecan M1000PRO between 40-60 min after adding the reagent. Activity of inhibitors is detected by reduction of luminescence signal compared to the negative control DMSO. Readout We are measuring luminescence after addition of BrightGlo (Promega). Signal is proportional to cell viability after exposure with the ReFRAME compounds. Background is the signal with media and reagent. Maximum signal is obtained with cells treated with DMSO.

reframedb_a00414	HTS screening for MEF2C transcriptional activators in hiPSC-derived neurons	Luciferase-based screening of MEF2C transcriptional activity, using hiPSC-derived neuronal progenitor cells.  Purpose Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) is a family of transcription factors that play a role in development, cell differentiation, and organogenesis. Our group previously discovered the Mef2c gene and showed that heterozygosity or brain-specific knockout using a Nestin-Cre driver produces mice with immature electrophysiological network properties, excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance, and behavioral deficits reminiscent of ASD, and Rett syndrome (RTT) in particular. Recent human genetic studies have established an association between MEF2C mutations and a form of ASD now known as MEF2C Haploinsufficiency Syndrome (MHS). Moreover, MEF2C reportedly functions as a coregulator of ASD-associated gene networks, We have generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from MHS patients, and generated neuronal progenitor cells (NPC). Activating the normal copy of MEF2C, may prevent some of the deficiencies observed using this â€œdisease-in-a-dishâ€ disease model. Since MEF2C is a coregulator of ASD-associated gene networks gene in neurodevelopment exerting transcriptional control over many other critical ASD candidate genes, our approach may lead to personalized therapies for multiple forms of ASD. Protocol hiPSCs are differentiated to NPCs using the dual SMAD inhibition protocol. The NPCs are cultures in high density in DMEM/F12 supplemented with BSA, N2 and B27. The cells are cultures on the following substrate: PEI, PDLO and Laminin. Cells are transfected with Luciferase-MEF2C reporter plasmid using electroporation method (Nucleofector, Lonza stem cell transfection kit).  First, Compounds are added to each well at a final concentration of 10uM. Then, cells are added to the 1536 wells, at a concentration of 5,000 cells per well, with a final volume of 5uL. 24 hours later, Luciferase activity is measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase kit (Promega).  Day -1: Coat plates with 6uL of Ornithine Day 0: Bluecat Wash 4x with water and add 6uL of Laminin (can store for up to a week) Day 1: Spin out Laminin on Bluecat wash and seed 5uL of cells and echo cmopounds Day 2: 2uL of steady glo and read  Readout Luciferase activity is measured in the cells, and normalized to untreated cells, and compared to a positive control.

reframedb_a00417	TLR9 inhibitor	Identification of TLR9 inhibitors using a cell-based assay Purpose Endosome maturation is a requirement for endosomal-initiated signaling in response to several stimuli, including the stimulation of the pattern recognition receptor TLR9 by unmethylated bacterial DNA. The activation of nucleic acid-sensing, endosomal TLRs, including TLR9, and late endosomal-TLR9 initiated signaling are central mechanisms in systemic inflammation and autoimmunity. In particular, unrestricted activation of endosomal TLRs is associated with inflammatory pathways that lead to a broad range of disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SLE, sJIA, type 1 diabetes and ischemia-reperfusion injury. My laboratory has identified the interaction of Munc13-4 with syntaxin 7 as an essential process for the regulation of endosomal TLR activation. We have identified inhibitors of this interaction using a different HTS, and those inhibitors were confirmed using the assay included in this proposal. Now, we propose a high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify, general, novel inhibitors of TLR9 activation. We anticipate that the newly identified inhibitors will prevent late endosomal maturation and decrease inflammation by impairing TLR9-dependent signaling pathways. The objective of this proposal is to utilize HTS approaches to identify small-molecule inhibitors of TLR9 activation for use in already available, downstream immune cell-based assays, and to downregulate systemic inflammation. Our long-term goal is to control TLR9 endosomal signaling to decrease inflammation associated with human disease. Protocol In our assay, we study TLR9 activation using HEK-Blueâ„¢-hTLR9 cells (InvivoGene). These cells  were obtained by co-transfection of the human TLR9 gene and an inducible SEAP (secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase) reporter gene into HEK293 cells. The SEAP gene is under the control of the IFN-Î² minimal promoter fused to five NF-ÎºB and AP-1-binding sites. Stimulation with a TLR9 ligand activates NF-ÎºB and AP-1 which induces the production and secretion of alkaline phosphatase. Levels of secreted alkaline phosphatase in the culture medium are detected using HEK-Blueâ„¢ Detection system, a colorimetry reaction that is read at (OD) 620-655 nm.  Protocol: Seed 10K HEK-blue hTLR9 cells, in 48 Âµl volume, in normal growth media, onto pre-spotted plate Incubate for 1 hour at 37Â°C Using OT-2 robot, add 2 Âµl of TLR9 agonist CpGB ODN 2006 at 12.5 Âµg/mL final concentration Incubate for 8h at 37Â°C in CO2 incubator Transfer 5 Âµl of supernatant for colorimetric reaction into plate containing 45 Âµl QuantiBlue Incubate the plate at 37Â°C for color development Read plate at 15â€™, 30â€™ and 1 hour in EnVision plate reader (OD) 620-655 nm.   This protocol has been successfully utilized to screen selective compounds and derivatives from the Mybridge library.   Readout The method is based on the quantitative analysis of secreted alkaline phosphatase which is proportional to the level of activation of TLR9 after CpG induction. We have optimized the system to provide consistent response after 8-hour activation by CpG. Longer incubation times increase the levels of secreted AP maintaining the correlation between stimulation and secretion and the ratio between stimulated and unstimulated samples. Positive controls are included utilizing known inhibitors of late endosomal maturation (chloroquine), which prevents TLR9 maturation and activation.  Intra- and inter-run variations, including well to well, plate to plate, and day to day variability will be calculated. The average Z-factor for the full screen and for individual plates will be calculated during all screenings to ensure high performance and low intra- and inter-run variations.

Phenotypic luminescence screening to identify novel molecules of interest. Purpose Balamuthia species cause a >95% fatal brain disease known as Balamuthia Amoebic Encephalitis (BAE) and also cutaneous lesions. Current therapeutics are not effective as they were never optimized as amoebacidal drugs. They are currently used because they have been identified to have some level of activity against these opportunistic parasites. Balamuthia has been found to encyst within tissues, being further problematic in the treatment of this disease. Identification of new drugs and or scaffolds would significantly improve the field for research and or treatments. No large drug screening methodology has previously been developed due to long doubling times of this parasite and the difficulty in axenic culture adaptation. We are one of a handful of labs in the world to be able to axenically culture this organism and expand cultures to be able to do high throughput screening.  Protocol Calibr plates will be prespotted with drug and sent frozen to UGA. Plates will be allowed to thaw at room temperature overnight. Plates will be centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 1 minute. Using the Biomek NXP 40 µl of 1x105 cells/ml B. mandrillaris will be seeded into the 384 well white, TC treated plates (Corning 3570 flat bottom) and incubated for 72 hours. At the 72 hour time point 10 µl of Promega's CellTiter-Glo 2.0 will be added to every well. Plates will be shaken for 2 minutes to induce cell lysis and be allowed to sit for 10 minutes to stabilise the luminescent signal.

reframedb_a00436	Osteoblast Differentiation	Identification of small molecules capable of stimulating mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts. Purpose Identifying small molecules that stimulate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate into osteoblasts is a potential strategy for bone repair. Smoothened agonist (SAG) and purmorphamine are identified small molecules that induce osteoblast markers in MSCs as part of the hedgehog pathway. This 384 well assay identifies osteoblast differentiation stimulators by measuring the alkaline phosphatase, a characteristic marker of active osteoblasts, using the AttoPhos AP fluorescent substrate system. An increase in signal corresponds to the differentiation from MSC to active osteoblast.  Protocol Compounds and controls are pre-spotted onto black, clear bottom 384-well microtiter plate at 1 ÂµM for primary screen and 20 ÂµM highest concentration of dose responsive confirmation assays. 50 uL of C3H10T1/2 cells at 2,500 cells/well density are plated and incubated for 144 hours (6 days). Following incubation, media is removed, and 20 uL of BME media without serum is added followed by 4 uL of passive lysis buffer and a 5 minute incubation period. 4 uL of AttoPhos (1 mM) is added, incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes and then the fluorescence is read using an excitation wavelength of 420 nm and an emission wavelength of 560 nm.  Readout AttoPhos is added to each well 144 hours after treatment, and after the cells have been lysed using the passive lysis buffer and the fluorescent signal is measured. The fluorescent signal is based on the amount of alkaline phosphatase present from the cells. Alkaline phosphatase is a characteristic marker of active osteoblasts.

reframedb_a00544	SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (main protease) inhibition high-throughput screen	Primary high-throughput FRET-based screen for the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease for the identification of therapeutics against COVID-19. Purpose SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 cleaves viral polyprotein to form functional viral proteins. Targeting of proteases has been effective for other viruses notably HIV and hepatitis. Thus, targeting of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is hypothesized to inhibit viral activity. This primary screen will identify new hit compounds which will be validated and screened in subsequent viral replication assays. Protocol Library was ordered and plated into black opaque 384-well plates (Greiner 781209) at 100nL of 10mM in DMSO. 10uL of diluted Mpro (80nM final concentration in reaction buffer: 20mM Tris pH 7.8, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100) was added with a MultiFlo FX liquid dispenser using a 5ÂµL cassette. Compounds were incubated with Mpro for 10 minutes at RT after which 10uL of substrate (8uM final concentration of either Ac-VKLQ-AFC or Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AFC) was dispensed into the plate and read using a Cytation 5 multi-mode reader immediately at 380/20 nm excitation and 500/20 nm emission wavelengths every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. Ac-Val-Lys-Leu-Gln-AFC and Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AFC fluorogenic substrates were monitored at 380/20 nm excitation and 500/20 nm emission wavelengths.

reframedb_a00505	Cell Viability Counterscreen for the SARS-CoV2 3CLpro Protease Inhibitor Assay	Secondary assay for the identification of off target hits from the SARS-CoV2 3CLpro protease assay using luminescence viability assay. Purpose Replication of coronaviruses, including the novel virus SARS-CoV2, requires the processing of two polyproteins by 2 virally encoded proteases. The chymotrypsin-like, 3CL protease cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites, while the papain-like protease (PLpro) cleaves the polyprotein at 3 sites and also cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 form target proteins for innate immune evasion. Inhibitors that block either protease could inhibit replication of the virus, and in the case of the 3CLpro, alleviate some immune system dampening. This secondary assay (1536 well format) will identify off target activity of the inhibitors identified as part of the 3CLpro primary cell based assay by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based activity. The luminescence signal is dependent on the amount of ATP available in metabolically active HEK293 cells, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate a reduction in cell viability. This assay is controlled using no cells (high control) vs cells treated with vehicle only (low control).  Protocol Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.

Purpose The current outbreak of COVID19 has underscored the lack of available therapeutics to treat coronavirus infections. The goal of this screen is to identify approved and investigational compounds that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. We will use A549 cells that stably overexpress human ACE2, which serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. A549 cells are a lung epithelial carcinoma cell line which is relevant to the biology of this virus since it infects the lungs. The SARS-CoV-2 virus we will use is genetically engineered to express Nanoluciferase, which yields a quantifiable readout that is a linear correlate of viral replication.   Protocol A549-hACE2 cells will be seeded at 2.5 x 104 cells/well in Costar 3603 black wall clear bottom 96 well plates the day before infection. The next day, confluent monolayers will be pre-treated with drugs in 100 uL medium for 2h, infected with MOI 0.025 SARS-CoV2 NanoLuc for 45 minutes, and post-treated with fresh drug in 100uL medium in duplicate. At 48h post-infection, 50 uL NanoGlo substrate will be added to wells, plates incubated 5 minutes, and luminescence recorded using a plate reader. Readout We will record Luminescence 5 minutes after addition of the NanoGlo substrate using a plate reader.

Purpose Replication of coronaviruses, including the novel virus SARS-CoV2, requires the processing of two polyproteins by 2 virally encoded proteases. The chymotrypsin-like, 3CL protease cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites, while the papain-like protease (PLpro) cleaves the polyprotein at 3 sites and also cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 form target proteins for innate immune evasion. Inhibitors that block either protease could inhibit replication of the virus. The 3CLpro is the Main protease (also known as Mpro) and is essential for replication. CoV 3CLpro has structural similarity to picornaviral 3Cpro, including those from HAV and Polio. Inhibitors of these picornavirus proteases have been pursued in the clinic. This 1536-well assay will identify inhibitors of the 3CLpro by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based cleavage reporter. The luminescence signal is dependent on cleavage by 3CLpro, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate inhibition. Cell viability is controlled by a constitutive Renilla luciferase reporter. Protocol Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.

reframedb_a00489	SARS-CoV2 Entry Inhibitor	Identification of SARS-CoV2 spike mediated inhibitors by luminescence assay. Purpose Entry of coronaviruses requires the sequential functions of two subunits of spike protein (S), S1 and S2 on the viral surface. S1 subunit or more precisely a smaller domain in this region called receptor binding domain (RBD) is primarily responsible for binding to functional receptors on target cells. S2 subunit facilitates the fusion of cell membrane with viral membrane, and its efficiency is determined by priming steps by cellular proteases as well as following conformational change. SARS2-CoV, the same as SARS-CoV, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for entry. Cleavage of S2’ site in S2 subunit by a serine protease named TMPRSS2 demonstrated a priming function and leads to a more efficient entry mediated by SARS2-CoV S. Therefore, inhibitors that either block the interaction of S1 or RBD with cellular receptors or the fusion mediated by S2 domain could inhibit entry of the virus. This 1536 well assay will identify inhibitors of the S-mediated entry by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based reporter delivered by a pseudotyped viral system. The luminescence signal is dependent on entry efficiency mediated by S, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate inhibition.  Protocol Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  HEK293 ACE2 expressing cells will be seeded at 2000 cells in 2.5uL of media into each well containing compounds and controls. After 1 hour incubation the pseudo virus particles will be seeded at 2.5uL/well in complete media. After 48 hour incubation, 5 uL of One Glo Firefly luciferase substrate will be added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes before luminescence reading on Perkin ViewLux.  Readout One Glo (Promega) substrate will be used to measure Firefly luciferase luminescence. Activity of the reporter will be measured by Firefly luciferase reporter output. Values will be normalized based on Fluc signal from cells plus media plus DMSO (positive) vs. cells plus MLV-SARS2-S Fmut virus infection +DMSO (negative).

reframedb_a00461	SARS-CoV2 Protease Inhibitor	Identification of SARS-CoV2 papain-like protease inhibitors by luminescence assay. Purpose Replication of coronaviruses, including the novel virus SARS-CoV2, requires the processing of two polyproteins by 2 virally encoded proteases. The chymotrypsin-like, 3CL protease cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites, while the papain-like protease (PLpro) cleaves the polyprotein at 3 sites and also cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 form target proteins for innate immune evasion. Inhibitors that block either protease could inhibit replication of the virus, and in the case of the PLpro, alleviate some immune system dampening. This 384 well assay will identify inhibitors of the PLpro by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based cleavage reporter. The luminescence signal is dependent on cleavage by PLpro, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate inhibition. Cell viability is controlled by a constitutive Renilla luciferase reporter. Protocol Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  Cells will be transfected with protease, reporter, and control constructs prior to use and 2500 cells in 5uL of media will be plated into each well containing compounds and controls. After 48 hour incubation, 5 uL of One Glo Firefly luciferase substrate will be added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes before luminescence reading on Perkin ViewLux.  Readout One Glo (Promega) substrate will be used to measure Firefly luciferase luminescence. Activity of the reporter will be measured by Firefly luciferase reporter output.

reframedb_a00508	Secondary assay counterscreen for SARS-CoV2 spike-mediated entry Inhibitor assay using CellTiter-Glo	Secondary assay for the identification of off target hits from the SARS-CoV2 entry assay using luminescence viability assay. Purpose Entry of coronaviruses requires the sequential functions of two subunits of spike protein (S), S1 and S2 on the viral surface. S1 subunit or more precisely a smaller domain in this region called receptor binding domain (RBD) is primarily responsible for binding to functional receptors on target cells. S2 subunit facilitates the fusion of cell membrane with viral membrane, and its efficiency is determined by priming steps by cellular proteases as well as following conformational change. SARS-CoV-2, the same as SARS-CoV, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for entry. Cleavage of S2’ site in S2 subunit by proteases, such as a serine protease named TMPRSS2, demonstrates a priming function and leads to a more efficient entry mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S. Therefore, inhibitors that either block the interaction of S1 or RBD with cellular receptors or the fusion mediated by S2 domain could inhibit entry of the virus. This secondary assay (1536 well format) will identify off target activity of the inhibitors identified as part of the SARS-CoV-2 primary cell-based assay by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based activity. The luminescence signal is dependent on the amount of ATP available in metabolically active HEK293 cells, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate a reduction in cell viability. This assay is controlled using no cells as the (high control) vs cells treated with vehicle only (low control). Protocol Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  Cells will be transfected with protease, reporter, and control constructs prior to use and 2000 cells in 5uL of media will be plated into each well containing compounds and controls. After 48 hour incubation, 5 uL of CellTiter-Glo Firefly luciferase substrate will be added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes before luminescence reading on Perkin ViewLux.  Readout CellTiter-Glo (Promega) substrate will be used to measure Firefly luciferase luminescence. Activity of the reporter will be measured by Firefly luciferase reporter output.

reframedb_a00509	VSV-G Counterscreen for the SARS-CoV2 Entry Inhibitor Assay	Secondary assay using the VSV-G pseudoparticles for the Identification of off-target SARS-CoV2 spike mediated inhibitors by luminescence assay. Purpose Entry of coronaviruses requires the sequential functions of two subunits of spike protein (S), S1 and S2 on the viral surface. S1 subunit or more precisely a smaller domain in this region called receptor binding domain (RBD) is primarily responsible for binding to functional receptors on target cells. S2 subunit facilitates the fusion of cell membrane with viral membrane, and its efficiency is determined by priming steps by cellular proteases as well as following conformational change. SARS-CoV-2, the same as SARS-CoV, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for entry. Cleavage of S2’ site in S2 subunit by proteases, such as a serine protease named TMPRSS2, demonstrates a priming function and leads to a more efficient entry mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S. Therefore, inhibitors that either block the interaction of S1 or RBD with cellular receptors or the fusion mediated by S2 domain could inhibit entry of the virus. In this 1536 well assay the SARS RBD was swapped out for VSV-G which will non-specifically infect any cell. Using this approach, we will identify inhibitors of non-specific entry by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based reporter delivered by a pseudotyped viral system. The luminescence signal is dependent on entry efficiency mediated by VSV-G, as opposed to the S protein in the primary assay, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate inhibition. Any inhibitor of the VSV-G counterscreen would thus be off target and not likely of further interest. Protocol Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  HEK293 ACE2 expressing cells will be seeded at 2000 cells in 2.5uL of media into each well containing compounds and controls.

reframedb_a00511	ReFRAME SARS CoV-2 Cytopathic Effect Reduction Cytotoxicity Assay	A cell viability assay was used to counter screen HTS hits from the ReFRAME to identify compounds with cytotoxic effect on VeroE6  host cells used in the HTS CPE Reduction assay. Purpose Compounds were screened for antiviral effect in a cell based assay measuring reduction of the cytopathic effect (CPE) of the SARS CoV-2 virus infecting Vero E6 host cells.   The viability of uninfected host cells after exposure to hit compounds for 72 hours is measured in a counter screen to determine and exclude compounds with cytotoxic effects. Protocol Cytotoxicity counter screen assay: Assay plates (Corning 3712BC) received from Calibr are pre-drugged with test compounds and 5 ?L media is added to each well. VeroE6 cells in media is added in 25?l aliquots (4000 cells/well) to each well.  Cells added to vehicle only wells are used to measure 100% viability (high signal controls) and cells treated with hyamine at 100µM final concentration are used to measure 0% viability (low signal controls).  After incubating plates at 37°C/5%CO2 and 90% humidity for 72 hours, 30?l Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) is added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes.  Readout Luminescence is read using a BMG PHERAStar reader to measure cell viability.  The raw data from plate readers are imported into ActivityBase where values are associated with compound IDs and test concentrations. Raw signal values are converted to % inhibition by the following formula:  % cell viability = 100*(test compound value - mean low signal control)/(mean high signal control – mean low signal control).  CC50 values are calculated from a four parameter logistic fit of data using the Xlfit module of ActivityBase. Detection Method atp levels are measured by a luminescent signal as an index of cell viability. the luminescent signal is generated in the atp dependent enzymatic conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin by firefly luciferase.

reframedb_a00466	SARS-CoV-2/HeLa-ACE2 24-hour infection HCI assay - % infected cells	High-content imaging cell-based assay to identify compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the HeLa cells expressing the human-ACE2 receptor.  This readout looks for a reduction in the percent SARS-CoV-2 positive cells 24 hours post-infection. Purpose This is a 384-well plate cell-based high-content imaging assay for identification of antiviral compounds with activity against SARS-CoV-2. The assay allows for concomitant measurement of SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition as determined by percent infected cells (reported here) and host cell cytotoxicity as determined by total host cell number (reported in assay A00485). The host cells used for infection are HeLa cells that exogenously express the human ACE2 receptor. Protocol 384w micro-clear Greiner plates are dry-spotted with 25 nL of compounds at a final concentration of 1.9 µM or 9.6 µM (depending on the use of a 2 mM or 10 mM library stock, respectively) and controls: remdesivir, apilimod, puromycin (for cell tox) and DMSO. Assay plates are seeded with HeLa-ACE2 cells using the MultiFlow liquid handler at Calibr and one hour later infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus in the BSL3 facility at TSRI. After a 24-hour incubation plates are fixed and stained with antibodies to visualize the virus (plasma purified from patients exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a secondary antibody tagged with Alexa488) and with DAPI to visualize host cell nuclei. Stained plates are imaged on the IXMC using a 10x objective and an algorithm to quantify infected cells. Readout High-content imaging of fluorescence identifies SARS-CoV-2-positive cells and total cells in each image. The assay readout is % infected cells normalized to neutral control minus inhibitors.

reframedb_a00485	SARS-CoV-2/HeLa-ACE2 24-hour infection HCI assay – total cell count	This is a secondary readout for the SARS-CoV-2/HeLa-ACE2 24-hour infection HCI assay. This readout looks at total number of HeLa-ACE2 cells 24 hours post-infection with SARS-CoV-2 as a proxy for viability. Note that only a limited and inconsistent cytopathic effect is observed in HeLa-ACE2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in this assay and this readout cannot be reliably tied to antiviral activity. Purpose This is a 384-well plate cell-based high-content imaging assay for identification of antiviral compounds with activity against SARS-CoV-2. The assay allows for concomitant measurement of SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition as determined by percent infected cells (reported in assay A00466) and host cell cytotoxicity as determined by total host cell number (reported here).

reframedb_a00478	Screen for COVID19 entry inhibitors	We have developed a COVID19 pseudovirus infection assay using Lentivirus pseudotyped with COVID19 spike. We have already carried out a duplicate 384-well LOPAC library screen and have excellent assay replication. We could also show that about half of the hits were not specific to COVID but also inhibited a VSV-G pseudotyped virus infection. We request to screen the ReFRAME or other libraries for inhibitory activity to COVID19 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry. Purpose The pseudovirus entry assay involves target cells, which are Hela cells transfected with hACE2. These are mixed with an equal volume of an optimal dose of COVID19-spike pseudotyped lentivirus and incubated for 48 hr on 384-well plates dotted with compounds. The pseudovirions encode a luciferase gene, the expression of which can be detected by subsequent lysis and incubation with BrightGlo substrate followed by measurement of luminescence. The unique aspect of this screen is that it should identify entry inhibitors, as distinct from polymerase or protease inhibitors which are currently being assessed. Protocol Protocol of 384-well plate compound screening is as follows. 25 ul COVID-19 pseudovirus stock is added to 384-well plates with spotted compounds and incubated for 30min. Next, 25 ul HeLa-ACE2 cells at 100,000/ml concentration are added to the wells. Plates are then incubated at 37 oC for 48 hours 30 ul Bright-glo (5 fold dilution in 1 X lysis buffer) is then added and incubated 5 min. Luminescence is then read. Readout Luciferase luminescence is measured. The low control is cells receiving medium instead of pseudovirions. Low and high controls are provided as columns of 16 wells each on each plate. In some cases, plates were read a second time at a later timepoint. Detection Method luminescence assay Detection Reagents Bright-glo substrate assay (Promega) is used, with assay carried out at room temperature. Components The assay uses a human cell line along with pseudovirions shown able to infect these cells only when they express human ACE2.
