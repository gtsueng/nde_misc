These surveys provide data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment.              Ideally 100% of patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhea would have received care at the hospital(s) or urgent care setting(s) participating in the study at the field site where cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea were counted and analyzed, designated henceforth as the ""sentinel health centers"". Because the catchment population at most of the sites was quite large and there are typically multiple sources of health care, it may be logistically impractical to maintain both surveillance for moderate-to-severe diarrhea and the ability to enroll patients into the case-control study at all the health care facilities that serve the population. Moreover, at each site some fraction of children would not reach a health care facility when they have moderate-to-severe diarrhea. If the HUAS indicates that the point estimate of patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhea treated at the sentinel health centers falls below 75%, measures were taken to try and increase this percentage by including additional health care facilities in the surveillance.        Objectives: Data from the GEMS1 1 HUAS/HUAS Lite surveys was used in different ways-        To optimize the surveillance for determining disease burden To perform data adjustments to account for the proportion of children with diarrhea who do not seek care at the health care facilities participating in GEMS surveillance To calculate population-based incidence rates To compare data between the different sites To assess public perception of the need for interventions to prevent childhood diarrhea   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS1, four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).          Dates of Data Collection: March 2007- December 2010; the HUAS survey was conducted at the beginning of the study and HUAS Lite was conducted twice a year over the course of the study.        Study Design: Community-based Cross-sectional Survey        Eligibility Criteria: From the census at each study site, updated by ongoing demographic surveillance, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). The census databases were as current as possible, in order to include recent births and to put children who have crossed an age group boundary in the appropriate group. The list defines the population from which the HUAS sample is drawn. Even with the updated list, there may be births between the time of preparation of the list and conduct of the survey, so that infants at the earliest ages may be somewhat underrepresented in the HUAS.              Each of the sites selected a random selection of approximately 400 eligible from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group, e.g., because of aging and higher mortality rates), and 370 eligible children from each of the two older age strata (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.        Data Collection: The interviewer went to the child's home and described the study to the selected child's parent or primary caretaker. If the parent or primary caretaker wished to participate, the consent form was read aloud by the interviewer in the local language and the parent/primary caretaker was given an opportunity to ask questions. Thereafter, s/he would either provide a signature or (if s/he did not know how to write) place a mark on the consent form (this could be an ""x"" or a fingerprint) in the presence of a witness (who would also sign the form) indicating his/her willingness to participate. The parent or primary caretaker received a copy of the signed consent form to keep and the original was stored in the regulatory files at the study site. The respondent was the child's primary caretaker. If a primary caretaker was not available, this was recorded and the interviewer tried to leave a message indicating when the interviewer would be likely to return. A total of 3 attempts were made to contact a primary caretaker after which time the child was considered a nonresponder.              The data collected from the ~60 questions asked include information about the household and family composition, occurrence of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. HUAS Lite contained a subset of questions from the longer HUAS survey. The HUAS questionnaire also provided an opportunity to query a representative sample of the population on their attitudes concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment. The survey may have been modified as appropriate for each site, while adhering to the main elements. In some countries, birth dates may not be known and it may be necessary to use an events calendar to estimate ages.              The questionnaires allowed the estimation of the ability of the sentinel health centers at each study site to capture at least 75% of the cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea within the 7-day eligibility period. The survey also made it possible to determine the true incidence of moderate-to-severe diarrhea at the end of the study period. If the child did not experience moderate-to-severe diarrhea during the past 14 days, then parents were asked hypothetical questions about their anticipated health care utilization should their child develop such an illness. This permitted a determination of the proportion of mothers who would use the sentinel health centers if their children had an episode of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in the future.Information on the respondents' perceptions about the danger of diarrheal diseases in children, their attitudes about the importance of developing vaccines and other interventions were also collected.

These surveys provide data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment.              Ideally 100% of patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhea would have received care at the hospital(s) or urgent care setting(s) participating in the study at the field site where cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea were counted and analyzed, designated henceforth as the ""sentinel health centers"". Because the catchment population at most of the sites was quite large and there are typically multiple sources of health care, it may be logistically impractical to maintain both surveillance for moderate-to-severe diarrhea and the ability to enroll patients into the case-control study at all the health care facilities that serve the population. Moreover, at each site some fraction of children would not reach a health care facility when they have moderate-to-severe diarrhea. If the HUAS indicates that the point estimate of patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhea treated at the sentinel health centers falls below 75%, measures were taken to try and increase this percentage by including additional health care facilities in the surveillance.        Objectives: Data from the GEMS1 1 HUAS/HUAS Lite surveys was used in different ways-        To optimize the surveillance for determining disease burden To perform data adjustments to account for the proportion of children with diarrhea who do not seek care at the health care facilities participating in GEMS surveillance To calculate population-based incidence rates To compare data between the different sites To assess public perception of the need for interventions to prevent childhood diarrhea   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS1, four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).          Dates of Data Collection: March 2007- December 2010; the HUAS survey was conducted at the beginning of the study and HUAS Lite was conducted twice a year over the course of the study.        Study Design: Community-based Cross-sectional Survey        Eligibility Criteria: From the census at each study site, updated by ongoing demographic surveillance, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). The census databases were as current as possible, in order to include recent births and to put children who have crossed an age group boundary in the appropriate group. The list defines the population from which the HUAS sample is drawn. Even with the updated list, there may be births between the time of preparation of the list and conduct of the survey, so that infants at the earliest ages may be somewhat underrepresented in the HUAS.              Each of the sites selected a random selection of approximately 400 eligible from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group, e.g., because of aging and higher mortality rates), and 370 eligible children from each of the two older age strata (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.        Data Collection: The interviewer went to the child's home and described the study to the selected child's parent or primary caretaker. If the parent or primary caretaker wished to participate, the consent form was read aloud by the interviewer in the local language and the parent/primary caretaker was given an opportunity to ask questions. Thereafter, s/he would either provide a signature or (if s/he did not know how to write) place a mark on the consent form (this could be an ""x"" or a fingerprint) in the presence of a witness (who would also sign the form) indicating his/her willingness to participate. The parent or primary caretaker received a copy of the signed consent form to keep and the original was stored in the regulatory files at the study site. The respondent was the child's primary caretaker. If a primary caretaker was not available, this was recorded and the interviewer tried to leave a message indicating when the interviewer would be likely to return. A total of 3 attempts were made to contact a primary caretaker after which time the child was considered a nonresponder.              The data collected from the ~60 questions asked include information about the household and family composition, occurrence of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. HUAS Lite contained a subset of questions from the longer HUAS survey. The HUAS questionnaire also provided an opportunity to query a representative sample of the population on their attitudes concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment. The survey may have been modified as appropriate for each site, while adhering to the main elements. In some countries, birth dates may not be known and it may be necessary to use an events calendar to estimate ages.              The questionnaires allowed the estimation of the ability of the sentinel health centers at each study site to capture at least 75% of the cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea within the 7-day eligibility period. The survey also made it possible to determine the true incidence of moderate-to-severe diarrhea at the end of the study period. If the child did not experience moderate-to-severe diarrhea during the past 14 days, then parents were asked hypothetical questions about their anticipated health care utilization should their child develop such an illness. This permitted a determination of the proportion of mothers who would use the sentinel health centers if their children had an episode of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in the future.Information on the respondents' perceptions about the danger of diarrheal diseases in children, their attitudes about the importance of developing vaccines and other interventions were also collected.

During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD).              At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study.        Objectives:  To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study. Mali and The Gambia recently introduced the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine.        Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018        Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study        Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.         Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria-  Age 0-59 months Belongs to the DSS Randomly selected from the DSS database  Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview.        Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. The parent/primary caretaker of each selected child was asked whether the child had diarrhea in the previous 7 days. If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where. An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage.  The child's vaccination card was examined and the dates that the child received vaccines against rotavirus, oral polio, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus containing vaccine, and the EPI center attended were recorded.    Study Documentation:    Questionnaires:  HUCS English questionnaire HUCS English questionnaire- short version       ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as SAS files.

Last Updated: October 10, 2022During the course of the Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study, a Health care Utilization and Coverage Survey (HUCS) was conducted semiannually as part of the Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) at each VIDA study site. In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of children from three age strata was selected and the HUCS was conducted by the DSS team during their routine rounds. The goal of the survey was to assess rotavirus vaccine coverage and to determine where children in the DSS seek care for moderate-to-severe diarrhea.	Case control study design

The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD).              At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study.        Objectives:  To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study. Mali and The Gambia recently introduced the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine.        Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018        Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study        Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.         Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria-  Age 0-59 months Belongs to the DSS Randomly selected from the DSS database  Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview.        Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. The parent/primary caretaker of each selected child was asked whether the child had diarrhea in the previous 7 days. If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where. An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage.  The child's vaccination card was examined and the dates that the child received vaccines against rotavirus, oral polio, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus containing vaccine, and the EPI center attended were recorded.

Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018        Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study        Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.         Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria-  Age 0-59 months Belongs to the DSS Randomly selected from the DSS database  Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview.        Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. The parent/primary caretaker of each selected child was asked whether the child had diarrhea in the previous 7 days. If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where. An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage.  The child's vaccination card was examined and the dates that the child received vaccines against rotavirus, oral polio, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus containing vaccine, and the EPI center attended were recorded.

Last Updated: October 10, 2022During the course of the Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study, a Health care Utilization and Coverage Survey (HUCS) was conducted semiannually as part of the Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) at each VIDA study site. In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of children from three age strata was selected and the HUCS was conducted by the DSS team during their routine rounds. The goal of the survey was to assess rotavirus vaccine coverage and to determine where children in the DSS seek care for moderate-to-severe diarrhea.	Documentation on ClinEpiDB
21	clinepidb_DS_6741e4cc0a	ClinEpiDB	VIDA HUCS Gambia Mali Survey	Related studies   VIDA Case Control Study VIDA HUCS Kenya    Background: Despite considerable progress in reducing diarrhea-related mortality over the past two decades, diarrheal diseases remain the second leading cause of post-neonatal death during the first 5 years of life in developing countries. During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD).              At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study.        Objectives:  To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study.

In 2012, among women who were estimated to be likely to have active syphilis, only 3% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 24% in Zambia were treated. In contrast, the WHO recommends that coverage of syphilis testing and treatment of positive cases among pregnant women should each be at least 95% in order to eliminate mother-to-child transmission.              While there is evidence that insufficient access to supplies hinders screening and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy in low-resource settings, additional interventions might be needed to overcome barriers related to health providers' behaviors regarding treatment and increase the likelihood that the supplies are used. This study assessed whether a multifaceted behavioral intervention based on previous research experience combined with the provision of supplies was more effective than providing supplies only to improve syphilis screening and treatment in seropositive pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Lusaka (Zambia).        Objectives: The primary objectives of the study were to determine if behavioral interventions 1) improved the likelihood that women were screened for syphilis at their first antenatal care visit, and 2) for those who screened positive, whether they were more likely to receive syphilis treatment at their first antenatal care visit. Secondary objectives included assessing:        The frequency with which women received screening for HIV at their first antenatal care visit The frequency with which women received screening for anemia at their first antenatal care visit The frequency with which women received screening for proteinuria at their first antenatal care visit   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: 16 antenatal care clinics in the Maluku and Nsele health areas, located in the capital city-province of Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were included in baseline data collection. 10 of those antenatal care clinics were included in the intervention phase. 10 clinics in health areas located within the capital province of Lusaka, Zambia were included in baseline data collection and the intervention phase.          Dates of Data Collection: Baseline data collection was conducted from April 1, 2015 to January 13, 2016 in the DRC and from April 13, 2015 to January 10, 2016 in Zambia. The intervention phase was conducted from February 1, 2016 to July 14, 2017 in the DRC and from February 8, 2016 to July 14, 2017 in Zambia.          Study Design: Cluster randomized trial          Eligibility Criteria: All pregnant women attending their first antenatal care visit at the participating clinics who consented to participate were eligible to be enrolled, irrespective of their gestational age. Antenatal care was defined as care during pregnancy before the initiation of labor. A first antenatal care visit was defined as the first visit in the participating facility during the current pregnancy.          Study Arms: All clinics received supplies for screening and treating syphilis, including rapid tests, benzathine penicillin, and anaphylaxis adverse reaction treatment, as well as training on using rapid tests. The intervention arm additionally received a multifaceted strategy consisting of:           Identification and training of opinion leaders among prenatal health providers, who disseminated, implemented, and maintained the best evidence practices using reminders, monitoring, and feedback. The goal was that facilitators learn: 1) priority health conditions to be screened and treated during pregnancy; 2) how to screen and manage maternal syphilis; and 3) how to effectively implement the congenital syphilis prevention program at the clinics in order to ensure all eligible women are screened and treated and that standard partner management is done. Packaging the supplies in kits: Point-of-care rapid test kits for syphilis diagnosis with instructions for immediate treatment, if positive; Treatment kits (benzathine penicillin 2.4 MU, syringe and needle, instructions, and information on side-effects); Anaphylaxis treatment kits for emergency use if needed (resources to treat an anaphylaxis adverse reaction according to local practice guidelines). Information on monitoring the availability of rapid tests and ensuring the availability of benzathine penicillin and anaphylaxis adverse reaction treatment.           Prenatal health providers at control clinics were invited to participate in a half-day training workshop where they were given refresher concepts on the prenatal care package and maternal and congenital syphilis and were trained in syphilis case detection and management, using standard and available screening methods.           Randomization: Baseline data was used in a covariate-adjusted randomization procedure (Ivers et al., 2012) to balance the intervention and control groups in regards to: (1) Number of first antenatal care visits; (2) Number of women screened for syphilis; (3) Number of women with a positive test for syphilis; (4) Number of first antenatal care visits per provider; (5) Percentage of women screened for syphilis; (6) Percentage of women positive for syphilis; (7) Country; (8) Type of Clinic.           Data Collection: Data regarding the participant's obstetric and syphilis history as well as testing for syphilis, HIV, proteinuria, and anemia were collected at a participant's first antenatal care visit for their current pregnancy. Data were obtained from source documents such as antenatal care log books, antenatal cards, prevention of mother-to-child transmission books, laboratory log books, and nursing log books. Data not available in source documents were collected by interviewing the women. Participants with a positive test for syphilis who did not receive treatment during the first visit were followed up by study personnel until their estimated date of delivery to ensure that all infected women received treatment before delivery. Participants were contacted at the subsequent antenatal care visits or by phone. The list of seropositive women who did not receive treatment at the first visit was communicated monthly to the country principal investigators to be shared with local health authorities.

In 2012, among women who were estimated to be likely to have active syphilis, only 3% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 24% in Zambia were treated. In contrast, the WHO recommends that coverage of syphilis testing and treatment of positive cases among pregnant women should each be at least 95% in order to eliminate mother-to-child transmission.              While there is evidence that insufficient access to supplies hinders screening and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy in low-resource settings, additional interventions might be needed to overcome barriers related to health providers' behaviors regarding treatment and increase the likelihood that the supplies are used. This study assessed whether a multifaceted behavioral intervention based on previous research experience combined with the provision of supplies was more effective than providing supplies only to improve syphilis screening and treatment in seropositive pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Lusaka (Zambia).        Objectives: The primary objectives of the study were to determine if behavioral interventions 1) improved the likelihood that women were screened for syphilis at their first antenatal care visit, and 2) for those who screened positive, whether they were more likely to receive syphilis treatment at their first antenatal care visit. Secondary objectives included assessing:        The frequency with which women received screening for HIV at their first antenatal care visit The frequency with which women received screening for anemia at their first antenatal care visit The frequency with which women received screening for proteinuria at their first antenatal care visit   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: 16 antenatal care clinics in the Maluku and Nsele health areas, located in the capital city-province of Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were included in baseline data collection. 10 of those antenatal care clinics were included in the intervention phase. 10 clinics in health areas located within the capital province of Lusaka, Zambia were included in baseline data collection and the intervention phase.          Dates of Data Collection: Baseline data collection was conducted from April 1, 2015 to January 13, 2016 in the DRC and from April 13, 2015 to January 10, 2016 in Zambia. The intervention phase was conducted from February 1, 2016 to July 14, 2017 in the DRC and from February 8, 2016 to July 14, 2017 in Zambia.          Study Design: Cluster randomized trial          Eligibility Criteria: All pregnant women attending their first antenatal care visit at the participating clinics who consented to participate were eligible to be enrolled, irrespective of their gestational age. Antenatal care was defined as care during pregnancy before the initiation of labor. A first antenatal care visit was defined as the first visit in the participating facility during the current pregnancy.          Study Arms: All clinics received supplies for screening and treating syphilis, including rapid tests, benzathine penicillin, and anaphylaxis adverse reaction treatment, as well as training on using rapid tests. The intervention arm additionally received a multifaceted strategy consisting of:           Identification and training of opinion leaders among prenatal health providers, who disseminated, implemented, and maintained the best evidence practices using reminders, monitoring, and feedback. The goal was that facilitators learn: 1) priority health conditions to be screened and treated during pregnancy; 2) how to screen and manage maternal syphilis; and 3) how to effectively implement the congenital syphilis prevention program at the clinics in order to ensure all eligible women are screened and treated and that standard partner management is done. Packaging the supplies in kits: Point-of-care rapid test kits for syphilis diagnosis with instructions for immediate treatment, if positive; Treatment kits (benzathine penicillin 2.4 MU, syringe and needle, instructions, and information on side-effects); Anaphylaxis treatment kits for emergency use if needed (resources to treat an anaphylaxis adverse reaction according to local practice guidelines). Information on monitoring the availability of rapid tests and ensuring the availability of benzathine penicillin and anaphylaxis adverse reaction treatment.           Prenatal health providers at control clinics were invited to participate in a half-day training workshop where they were given refresher concepts on the prenatal care package and maternal and congenital syphilis and were trained in syphilis case detection and management, using standard and available screening methods.           Randomization: Baseline data was used in a covariate-adjusted randomization procedure (Ivers et al., 2012) to balance the intervention and control groups in regards to: (1) Number of first antenatal care visits; (2) Number of women screened for syphilis; (3) Number of women with a positive test for syphilis; (4) Number of first antenatal care visits per provider; (5) Percentage of women screened for syphilis; (6) Percentage of women positive for syphilis; (7) Country; (8) Type of Clinic.           Data Collection: Data regarding the participant's obstetric and syphilis history as well as testing for syphilis, HIV, proteinuria, and anemia were collected at a participant's first antenatal care visit for their current pregnancy. Data were obtained from source documents such as antenatal care log books, antenatal cards, prevention of mother-to-child transmission books, laboratory log books, and nursing log books. Data not available in source documents were collected by interviewing the women. Participants with a positive test for syphilis who did not receive treatment during the first visit were followed up by study personnel until their estimated date of delivery to ensure that all infected women received treatment before delivery. Participants were contacted at the subsequent antenatal care visits or by phone. The list of seropositive women who did not receive treatment at the first visit was communicated monthly to the country principal investigators to be shared with local health authorities.

14	clinepidb_DS_0086998c2f	ClinEpiDB	SHINE Cluster Randomized Trial	Related studies:   WASH Benefits Bangladesh WASH Benefits Kenya    Background: Childhood stunting and anemia are a perverse public health problem in developing countries. Globally, stunting affects 26% of children under the age of five and underlies 15-17% of their mortality. Stunting has been shown to lead to long-term cognitive deficits, few years and poorer performance in school, lower economic productivity as adults and a higher risk of stunting in their own children.        Objectives: The SHINE trial was motivated by a two part premise.         Environmental enteric dysfunction (EDD) is a major cause of child stunting and anemia     Primary cause of EED is infant ingestion of fecal microbes due to living condition of poor quality and quantity of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)    Primary study objective:    Determine the independent and combined effects of improved household WASH and improved IYCF on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV negative women in rural Zimbabwe.    Secondary study objectives:   Examine the effects of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on stunting (LAZ less than -2) anemia (hemoglobin less than 105 g/L) among children at 18 mo of age who are born to HIV-negative women in rural Zimbabwe. Examine differential effects on length and hemoglobin concentration at 18 mo of the 2 randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) in these prespecified subgroups: children born to HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative mothers; male and female children; Subgroups formed by categorizing household wealth, household distance from a water point, and maternal capabilities. Examine the independent and combined effects of the 2 randomized interventions on body weight, mid-upper arm circumference and head circumference at 18 mo, and on all anthropometric measures at intermediate ages (1, 3, 6, and 12 mo). Describe the PIP linking implementation of each randomized intervention (WASH and IYCF) with length and hemoglobin concentrations. Assess potential effect modifiers along the PIP Describe the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among all infants enrolled in the trial by maternal/infant HIV status.  Evaluate the effect of the IYCF intervention on uptake of improved infant feeding practices by maternal/infant HIV status.  Evaluate the effect of the WASH intervention on the five key behaviors it promotes by maternal/infant HIV status: proper disposal of animal and human feces; handwashing with soap after fecal contact; point-of-use chlorination of drinking water; protecting children from ingestion of dirt and feces; feeding baby freshly prepared foods, or reheating leftover food. Elucidate the biological pathways linking WASH and IYCF with linear growth and hemoglobin concentration by measuring domains of EED, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status. Measure the impact of the two randomized interventions (WASH and IYCF) on incidence, prevalence, and severity of diarrheal disease in infants, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status Model the relative contributions of diarrheal disease and EED in mediating the effects of improved WASH on child length and hemoglobin concentrations, stratified by maternal/infant HIV status  Measure the strength of association between severity of maternal EED and systemic inflammation during pregnancy with the risk of 6 adverse  birth outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, fetal stunting, low birth weight and neonatal death), stratified by maternal HIV status. Measure the strength of association between other potential causes of stunting and anemia (other than poorWASH or IYCF) with linear growth and hemoglobin.    Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The SHINE study was conducted in the contiguous districts of Chirumanzu and Shurugwi in Zimbabwe. These districts were chosen based of the following criteria:         Rural districts with low sanitation coverage (53% for these districts, with 45% open defecation) High prevalence of child stunting (mean LAZ at 18 months and 24 months, -1.89 and -1.97) Reasonable road access throughout the year District level primary healthcare services that offer facility-based antenatal care and deliveries  Geographically contiguousness Stakeholder receptivity     Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - June 2017        Study Design: SHINE was a cluster-randomized, community-base 2 x 2 factoral trial in two contiguous districts in Zimbabwe. The study area was divided into 212 clusters. Each clusters were allocated (1:1:1:1) to one of the four treatment groups: (1) standard of care, (2) infant and young child feeding, (3) WASH or (4) sanitation/hygiene and nutrition.         Eligibility Criteria: Women were eligible for inclusion if they permanently resided in a study cluster and were confirmed pregnant. During the recruitment period, the cutoff of gestational age for eligibility was gradually loosened (from 14 weeks' gestational age to just before parturition) to maximise recruitment.        Study Arms:  In the standard-of-care group, village health workers promoted exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, advised on neonatal care, and promoted uptake of Ministry of Health and Child Care services, including antenatal care, immunizations, and family planning. In the WASH group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages, plus information about safe disposal of feces, handwashing with soap at key times, protection of infants from geophagia and ingestion of animal feces, chlorination of drinking water (especially for infants), and hygienic preparation of complementary food. Additionally, ventilated improved pit latrines were constructed and two handwashing stations were installed by community builders supervised by Ministry of Health and Child Care environmental health technicians within 6 weeks of enrolment. A plastic mat and play yard were delivered to the home by a trial logistician at 2 and 6 months postnatal, respectively, and village health workers made monthly deliveries of soap from the time of the handwashing module (roughly 30 weeks antenatal) and chlorine from the time of the water treatment module (4 months postnatal) until 18 months postnatal. In the IYCF group, village health workers delivered all the standard-of-care messages plus information about the importance of nutrition for infant health, growth, and development; feeding nutrient-dense food and 20 g of a small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement daily from age 6 to 18 months; processing foods to facilitate mastication and swallowing; feeding during illness; and dietary diversity. Participants also received monthly deliveries of 30 sachets of the small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement from infant age 6 months to 18 months postnatal. In the combined group, participants received all standard-of-care, WASH, and IYCF interventions.   Data Collection: Research nurses made home visits at baseline (roughly 2 weeks after mothers provided consent), 32 weeks' gestation, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post partum to assess maternal and household characteristics and trial outcomes. Intervention uptake was assessed at all visits and reported here as prespecified for the 12-month postnatal visit. At baseline, mothers' height, weight, mid-upper-arm circumference, and haemoglobin concentrations were measured. They were also tested for Schistosoma haematobium (by urinary microscopy) and HIV (via the rapid test algorithm). Other maternal and household characteristics assessed included dietary diversity, food insecurity, household wealth, and maternal capabilities.

These datasets were merged by unique ID and redundant or administrative columns were dropped from presentation on ClinEpiDB.org. All dates were dropped to comply with the ethical conduct of human subjects research.        Financial Support: The SHINE trial is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1021542 to Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and OPP1143707 to Zvitambo Institute for Maternal and Child Health Research), the UK Department for International Development, the Wellcome Trust (093768/Z/10/Z and 108065/Z/15/Z), the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (8106727), UNICEF (PCA-2017-0002), and the US National Institutes of Health (R01 HD060338/HD/NICHD).        Ethics Statement: The Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe and the Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health approved the study protocol. All participants provided written informed consent.        Last Updated: February 14, 2023The SHINE trial was a cluster-randomized trial that sought to determine the independent and combined effects of improved household water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 months of age living in 2 rural districts in Zimbabwe. Clusters were defined as a catchment area of 1-4 community-based village health workers from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care. Clusters were randomized to one of four intervention arms - 1) standard of care, 2) infant and young child feeding intervention (IYCF), 3) WASH intervention, and 4) combined IYCF + WASH. Data collection was performed at baseline, 32 weeks gestation and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months postpartum.

Using a computerized number generator, random samples of households from each sub-county were approached consecutively, and 100 households were enrolled per site from August - September 2011 into both the entomologic surveys and cohort studies if they met the following criteria:          At least one household resident 0.5-10 years of age At least one adult resident available for providing informed consent 300 households (100 per site) were enrolled Aug-Sept 2011 and an additional 31 households were enrolled Aug-Sept 2013 to replace households withdrawn during the 1st two years of follow-up           All children and up to one primary caregiver from each household were enrolled into the cohort study if they met the following eligibility criteria:          Documented age between 6 months and <10 years for children Full time resident of the household No intention to move out of the sub-county for the next two years Agreement to come to a dedicated study clinic located within the sub-county for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications administered outside this study Provision of written informed consent from parent or guardian           Cohorts were dynamic - all newly eligible children were enrolled and study participants reaching 11 years of age were excluded from further follow-up. Study participants were withdrawn from the study based on:          Permanent movement out of the sub-county Inability to be located for > 4 months Withdrawal of informed consent Inability to comply with the study schedule and procedures Child reaching 11 years of age A household was withdrawn when all cohort study participants from the household were withdrawn.  Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months. In subset of children starting in December 2014, routine blood smears were done every month.            Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted once a month in each household participating in the cohort studies. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot end of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning by field workers. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or ""other"") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys.

Objectives:  Perform comprehensive surveillance studies aimed to improve understanding of malaria and measure the impact of population-level control interventions Bring together expertise from multiple disciplines to collect data across multiple levels, reflecting the complex nature of interactions between the mosquito vector, malaria parasite and human host Assess transmission in three sites, ranging from areas of relatively low transmission intensity to areas with some of the highest transmission intensities recorded in the world Emphasize local training and capacity building, transfer of technology, and building strong relationships between researchers and policymakers  Methodology:   Geographic Location/Study Sites: Uganda, Walukuba (Jinja District), Kihihi (Kanungu District), Nagongera (Tororo District)            Dates of Data Collection: August 2011-June 2017. Note that participants from Walukuba and Kihihi sub-counties were followed through June 30, 2016 while participants from Nagongera sub-county were followed for an extra year, through June 30, 2017.          Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with passive and active malaria case detection and entomological surveillance          Eligibility Criteria: All households in each sub-county were enumerated and mapped (households were defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) from January - June 2011. Using a computerized number generator, random samples of households from each sub-county were approached consecutively, and 100 households were enrolled per site from August - September 2011 into both the entomologic surveys and cohort studies if they met the following criteria:          At least one household resident 0.5-10 years of age At least one adult resident available for providing informed consent 300 households (100 per site) were enrolled Aug-Sept 2011 and an additional 31 households were enrolled Aug-Sept 2013 to replace households withdrawn during the 1st two years of follow-up           All children and up to one primary caregiver from each household were enrolled into the cohort study if they met the following eligibility criteria:          Documented age between 6 months and <10 years for children Full time resident of the household No intention to move out of the sub-county for the next two years Agreement to come to a dedicated study clinic located within the sub-county for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications administered outside this study Provision of written informed consent from parent or guardian           Cohorts were dynamic - all newly eligible children were enrolled and study participants reaching 11 years of age were excluded from further follow-up. Study participants were withdrawn from the study based on:          Permanent movement out of the sub-county Inability to be located for > 4 months Withdrawal of informed consent Inability to comply with the study schedule and procedures Child reaching 11 years of age A household was withdrawn when all cohort study participants from the household were withdrawn.  Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months. In subset of children starting in December 2014, routine blood smears were done every month.            Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted once a month in each household participating in the cohort studies. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot end of the bed where a cohort study participant slept.

Note that participants from Walukuba and Kihihi sub-counties were followed through June 30, 2016 while participants from Nagongera sub-county were followed for an extra year, through June 30, 2017.          Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with passive and active malaria case detection and entomological surveillance          Eligibility Criteria: All households in each sub-county were enumerated and mapped (households were defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) from January - June 2011. Using a computerized number generator, random samples of households from each sub-county were approached consecutively, and 100 households were enrolled per site from August - September 2011 into both the entomologic surveys and cohort studies if they met the following criteria:          At least one household resident 0.5-10 years of age At least one adult resident available for providing informed consent 300 households (100 per site) were enrolled Aug-Sept 2011 and an additional 31 households were enrolled Aug-Sept 2013 to replace households withdrawn during the 1st two years of follow-up           All children and up to one primary caregiver from each household were enrolled into the cohort study if they met the following eligibility criteria:          Documented age between 6 months and <10 years for children Full time resident of the household No intention to move out of the sub-county for the next two years Agreement to come to a dedicated study clinic located within the sub-county for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications administered outside this study Provision of written informed consent from parent or guardian           Cohorts were dynamic - all newly eligible children were enrolled and study participants reaching 11 years of age were excluded from further follow-up. Study participants were withdrawn from the study based on:          Permanent movement out of the sub-county Inability to be located for > 4 months Withdrawal of informed consent Inability to comply with the study schedule and procedures Child reaching 11 years of age A household was withdrawn when all cohort study participants from the household were withdrawn.  Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months. In subset of children starting in December 2014, routine blood smears were done every month.            Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted once a month in each household participating in the cohort studies. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot end of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning by field workers. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or ""other"") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. In a random subset of female Anopheles mosquitoes the proportion infected with sporozoites were measured using an ELISA technique.

Using a computerized number generator, random samples of households from each sub-county were approached consecutively, and 100 households were enrolled per site from August - September 2011 into both the entomologic surveys and cohort studies if they met the following criteria:          At least one household resident 0.5-10 years of age At least one adult resident available for providing informed consent 300 households (100 per site) were enrolled Aug-Sept 2011 and an additional 31 households were enrolled Aug-Sept 2013 to replace households withdrawn during the 1st two years of follow-up           All children and up to one primary caregiver from each household were enrolled into the cohort study if they met the following eligibility criteria:          Documented age between 6 months and <10 years for children Full time resident of the household No intention to move out of the sub-county for the next two years Agreement to come to a dedicated study clinic located within the sub-county for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications administered outside this study Provision of written informed consent from parent or guardian           Cohorts were dynamic - all newly eligible children were enrolled and study participants reaching 11 years of age were excluded from further follow-up. Study participants were withdrawn from the study based on:          Permanent movement out of the sub-county Inability to be located for > 4 months Withdrawal of informed consent Inability to comply with the study schedule and procedures Child reaching 11 years of age A household was withdrawn when all cohort study participants from the household were withdrawn.  Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months. In subset of children starting in December 2014, routine blood smears were done every month.            Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted once a month in each household participating in the cohort studies. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot end of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning by field workers. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or ""other"") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. In a random subset of female Anopheles mosquitoes the proportion infected with sporozoites were measured using an ELISA technique.

The data presented in ClinEpiDB include the longitudinal cohort and entomological surveillance component of the PRISM study.           Objectives:  Perform comprehensive surveillance studies aimed to improve understanding of malaria and measure the impact of population-level control interventions Bring together expertise from multiple disciplines to collect data across multiple levels, reflecting the complex nature of interactions between the mosquito vector, malaria parasite and human host Assess transmission in three sites, ranging from areas of relatively low transmission intensity to areas with some of the highest transmission intensities recorded in the world Emphasize local training and capacity building, transfer of technology, and building strong relationships between researchers and policymakers  Methodology:   Geographic Location/Study Sites: Uganda, Walukuba (Jinja District), Kihihi (Kanungu District), Nagongera (Tororo District)            Dates of Data Collection: August 2011-June 2017. Note that participants from Walukuba and Kihihi sub-counties were followed through June 30, 2016 while participants from Nagongera sub-county were followed for an extra year, through June 30, 2017.          Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with passive and active malaria case detection and entomological surveillance          Eligibility Criteria: All households in each sub-county were enumerated and mapped (households were defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) from January - June 2011. Using a computerized number generator, random samples of households from each sub-county were approached consecutively, and 100 households were enrolled per site from August - September 2011 into both the entomologic surveys and cohort studies if they met the following criteria:          At least one household resident 0.5-10 years of age At least one adult resident available for providing informed consent 300 households (100 per site) were enrolled Aug-Sept 2011 and an additional 31 households were enrolled Aug-Sept 2013 to replace households withdrawn during the 1st two years of follow-up           All children and up to one primary caregiver from each household were enrolled into the cohort study if they met the following eligibility criteria:          Documented age between 6 months and <10 years for children Full time resident of the household No intention to move out of the sub-county for the next two years Agreement to come to a dedicated study clinic located within the sub-county for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications administered outside this study Provision of written informed consent from parent or guardian           Cohorts were dynamic - all newly eligible children were enrolled and study participants reaching 11 years of age were excluded from further follow-up. Study participants were withdrawn from the study based on:          Permanent movement out of the sub-county Inability to be located for > 4 months Withdrawal of informed consent Inability to comply with the study schedule and procedures Child reaching 11 years of age A household was withdrawn when all cohort study participants from the household were withdrawn.  Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months. In subset of children starting in December 2014, routine blood smears were done every month.            Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted once a month in each household participating in the cohort studies. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot end of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning by field workers. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or ""other"") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. In a random subset of female Anopheles mosquitoes the proportion infected with sporozoites were measured using an ELISA technique.          Population Level Vector Control Interventions: Universal Long-lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN)campaigns were carried out in Walukuba in November 2013, Kihihi in June 2014 and Nagongera in November 2013. District wide indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide was conducted only in Nagongera.

However, transmission is endemic in 21 of 25 provinces and it is estimated that 58% of the population, or approximately 8.6 million people, continue to live in malaria at-risk areas. The incidence of clinical cases is highest in the north-eastern part of the country, with the highest risk in forest or forest fringe areas of the country, usually found along the borders. It is therefore very important to i) characterize region specific demographic and geographic determinants of (especially asymptomatic) malaria infection ii) determine the relationship between different measures of malaria infection and exposure and iii) implement malaria surveillance and control strategies using this knowledge to optimise the distribution of limited resources to detect as many infections as possible.

17	clinepidb_DS_08b80ee6ae	ClinEpiDB	Amazonia ICEMR2- Brazil Rio Azul	Background: Malaria remains common among native Amazonians, challenging Brazil′s elimination efforts.      Objectives: We examined the epidemiology of malaria in riverine populations of the country′s main hotspot, the upper Juruá Valley in Acre state close to the Brazil-Peru border, where Plasmodium vivax accounts for >80% of cases.      Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Municipality of Mâncio Lima, in the upper Juruá Valley region of Acre state, westernmost Brazil, close to the border with Peru.       Dates of Data Collection: The first survey was carried out between 9-12 July, 2018; the second survey was carried out between 9-12 July, 2019.       Study Design: Prosepective panel study      Eligibility: The participants must have met the following criteria- Permanent residents in riverine communities situated along Azul River, Acre, Brazil.       Data Collection: For the first survey in 2018, 246 individuals aged between 1 and 72 years were invited to provide a finger-prick blood sample. For the second survey 2019, 244 participants aged < 1-75 years, coming from nine villages, were interviewed using the same structured questionnaire applied in 2018.           Overall, we enrolled 386 individuals and tested 262 (67.9%) of them for malaria parasites during at least one survey; 36 (9.3%) participants were tested during both surveys. Those who reported recent signs or symptoms at or up to 7 days were classified as “symptomatic”.           The first survey, 2018: house-to-house visits (in 10 riverine villages or “communities” on the banks of the Azul River, a tributary of the Moa River, all of them originated from former rubber-tapper settlements: Três Unidos, Valparaíso, Barro Vermelho, Belo Horizonte, Buritis, Nova Lição, Bom Sossego, Bela Vista, Bom Jesus and Queimadas) by using structured questionnaire to obtain sociodemographic and morbidity information. In addition, finger-prick blood sample from the participants was collected as well.           For the second survey 2019, residents in the area were invited to attend medical and dental care, routine vaccination and cervical cancer screening in health posts or schools situated in one of three largest villages (Três Unidos, Nova Lição and Bom Sossego), using the same structured questionnaire applied in 2018 and finger-prick blood sample.           Laboratory Methods:     Thick blood smears were stained with Giemsa and had at least 100 fields examined for malaria parasites, under 1,000x magnification, by an experienced microscopist. P. vivax infections diagnosed by onsite microscopy were treated with chloroquine (25 mg/kg of body weight over 3 days) and primaquine (3.5 mg/kg over 7 days); Plasmodium falciparum infections were treated with a 3-day course of artemether (2 to 4 mg/kg/day) plus lumefantrine (12 to 24 mg/kg/day) and a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg primaquine for gametocyte clearance.           Molecular screening for malaria was carried out with a genus-specific, SYBR Green-based quantitative PCR. Positive samples were further tested with newly designed TaqMan assays that target species-specific cytb gene fragments.

Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. Children and males were found to be at higher risk of malaria than older people and females. In 2017, we undertook a subsequent behavioral survey among 500 participants in 237 households of four of the medium and high malaria villages.         Objectives: Investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk.        Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Odisha, India        Dates of Data Collection: February-May 2017        Study Design: Cross-sectional survey        Eligibility Criteria: Participants must have been aged 12 months to 69 years.

Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. Our analyses showed that the rainy season and male gender were risk factors for malaria; in high malaria villages, young age was an additional risk factor, and indoor and outdoor spraying was protective compared to no spraying. We undertook a subsequent behavioral survey in four of the medium and high malaria villages in 2017 to investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk among 500 participants in 237 households.

Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. Children and males were found to be at higher risk of malaria than older people and females. In 2017, we undertook a subsequent behavioral survey among 500 participants in 237 households of four of the medium and high malaria villages.         Objectives: Investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk.        Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Odisha, India        Dates of Data Collection: February-May 2017        Study Design: Cross-sectional survey        Eligibility Criteria: Participants must have been aged 12 months to 69 years. Pregnant women were excluded.        Data Collection: In a published survey around Rourkela in 2013-2014 (N=1307), malaria  prevalence was found to be 8.3%. Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. Our analyses showed that the rainy season and male gender were risk factors for malaria; in high malaria villages, young age was an additional risk factor, and indoor and outdoor spraying was protective compared to no spraying. We undertook a subsequent behavioral survey in four of the medium and high malaria villages in 2017 to investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk among 500 participants in 237 households. Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with sections on malaria history and use of mosquito protection; blood was collected for microscopy, a rapid malaria test, and PCR testing.

During this period, children are also at risk for undernutrition.              Beyond the acute morbidity and suffering caused by enteric infections and undernutrition, observational evidence       also suggests that repeated infections alone and in combination with undernutrition in the first years of life can       have lasting and detrimental effects on longer-term physical growth, cognitive development, and adult human capital.              The WASH Benefits studies provides rigorous evidence on the health and developmental benefits of water quality,       sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions during the first years of life. A cluster-randomized controlled       trial measured the impact of intervention among newborn infants in rural Kenya. The study is large in scope       (> 7,000 newborns) and has eight arms (six treatment arms and two control arms). Primary outcomes were measured after       two years of intervention.             Objectives: The goal of the WASH Benefits studies is to generate rigorous evidence about the impacts of       sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and development in the first years of       life. The WASH Benefits Kenya study is highly comparable to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh study; both cluster randomized       trials investigated the effects of the same six treatment arms.           The study has three primary scientific objectives:  Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and         development after 2 years of intervention. Determine whether there are larger reductions in diarrhea when providing a combined water, sanitation and handwashing         intervention compared to each component alone. Determine whether there are larger effects on growth and development from combining a) daily supplemental nutrition         with b) a combined water, sanitation and handwashing intervention compared to each component alone.   The study has three secondary scientific objectives: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Measure the impact of nutritional supplements and household environmental interventions on environmental enteropathy         biomarkers, and more clearly elucidate this potential pathway between environmental interventions and child growth and development. Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing and nutritional interventions on intestinal parasitic infection         prevalence and intensity. Measure the association between parasitic infection and other measures of enteric health, including acute diarrhea and environmental         enteropathy biomarkers.   The tertiary scientific objective of the study was to measure the impact of interventions on the following outcomes: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Weight-for-age at 1 and 2 years Weight-for-height at 1 and 2 years Underweight at 2 years Wasting at 2 years Severe stunting at 2 years Head circumference-for-age at 1 year and 2 years Soil-transmitted helminth infection at 2 years Protozoan infection at 2 years Verbal Communicative Development Inventory at 1 year WHO motor milestones at 1 year Acute respiratory illness All cause mortality      Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The trial was conducted in rural areas of 10 districts in Bungoma, Kakamega and Vihiga counties in the western        part of Kenya. The region is populated mainly by subsistence farmers. Unimproved latrine coverage is high (at least 85%). A pilot study in the region       estimated that among children <27 months old, 11% had diarrhea in the preceding 2 days. Very few (<5%) households had piped water and the majority of households        reported obtaining drinking water from sources where chlorination has previously been shown to be effective (such as protected springs).         Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - May 2014         Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6 treatment arms, a passive control arm, and a double-sized active control arm. Pregnant women        were enrolled, and outcomes were assessed in the children following 12 and 24 months of intervention.         Eligibility Criteria: The study communities must have met the following criteria:         Rural communities (defined as villages with <25% of residents living in rental houses, <2 gas/petrol stations and <10 shops) Not enrolled in ongoing water, sanitation, hygiene, or nutrition programs Most of the population relied on communal water sources and had unimproved sanitation facilities At least six eligible pregnant women in the cluster at baseline    Study Arms: Clusters were randomized to one of 8 study arms. Intervention delivery occurred within 3 months after enrollment of pregnant women, prior        to or as close to birth as possible. Compounds shared a latrine, so sanitation and handwashing interventions were delivered a the compound-level. Nutritional        interventions were delivered directly to the child participant within households.          Water quality: The study installed chlorine dispensers within the cluster boundary at public water sources used by study participants.          All community members were also able to use the dispensers. After filling their water collection container (typically a 20 L plastic jerry can) at the          source, users could place the container under the dispenser and turn a knob to release 3 mL of 1.25% sodium hypochlorite, an amount designed to yield          2 mL/L of free chlorine residual after 30 min for 20 L of water. The study also included community level promotion of dispenser use and all households          in the study compound received bottles of sodium hypochlorite (6 months' supply) to facilitate householders' water treatment during periods when they          rely on rainwater harvesting (common during the rainy season) or if they use a water source in which a dispenser has not been installed. Households were          visited monthly by community-based health promoters.  Sanitation: The sanitation intervention included three hardware components: (1) All existing latrines in the compound were          upgraded by installing a plastic slab with a tight-fitting lid. Households without latrines or with poor qualiity latrines were provided with         a new dual pit latrine. (2) Sani-scoop hoes dedicated to the removal of human and animal feces from the compound were provided to all households          in the compound. (3) Plastic child potties were provided to all households in the compound that had any children younger than 3 years. The behavior change components of         the intervention emphasized the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of feces in the compound courtyard to prevent         contact with young children. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Handwashing: The hardware components of the handwashing intervention included two handwashing stations installed in all households.          The first station was located in the kitchen (location of food preparation) and the other located near the toilet. Handwashing stations were constructed from locally available materials and included         a dual tippy-tap design with independent pedals attached to two 5 L jerry cans of clean water and soapy water. The study provided detergent soap to families          free of charge to replenish the soapy water bottles. The behavior change component of the intervention focused messaging for handwashing at two critical times:          after defecation and before food preparation. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing (WSH): Households received all three of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          and handwashing study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Nutrition: Mothers were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children through age 6 months. When newborns reached         6 months of age, mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding their children until 24 months, and received education about         supplementing breastfeeding with healthy complementary foods following infant and young child feeding best practice guidelines from         Unicef and         WHO.         From ages 6 - 24 months, study children received a daily lipid-based nutritional supplement (LNS) that has been developed and tested         through the iLiNS project. The study also provided LNS to older, age-eligible siblings (6-24 months)          living in study households to prevent potential sharing of LNS with older siblings. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing + Nutrition (WSHN): Households received all four of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          handwashing, and nutrition study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Double-sized active control arm: Households did not receive any intervention, but were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Passive control arm: Households did not receive any intervention and were not visited by community-based health promotors.   Units of Data Collection: Clusters consisted of 1 or more administrative villages; two or more neighboring may have been combined to create 1 cluster as        long as the cluster of villages had at least 8 eligible pregnant women and shared a border. Households were the family unit of parents and children, and compounds        were groups of households (typically 1-4 households from the same extended family). When multiple pregnant women from a single compound were eligible for        enrollment, more than one household may have been enrolled for that compound. Data about each compound were collected from households belonging to        that compound, and responses from various households about that compound's characteristics may differ.        Children who were born to the pregnant women initially enrolled in the study were        considered ""target"" children. Children aged <36 months living in the compound at enrollment and additional children born into study compounds after 6 months were        considered ""sibling/neighbor"" children.         Data Collection: A survey at enrollment (year 0, pre-intervention baseline) measured household socioeconomic characteristics and demographics (including maternal        age, maternal education, electricity access, type of floor, and number of people in the household), as well as water, sanitation, and handwashing infrastructure and behaviors        (including type of water source, reported water treatment, defecation location, type of toilet, and presence of water and soap at a handwashing station). Adherence to the        interventions was measured by surveying each enrolled household during unannounced visits 1 year post-intervention (midline) and 2 years post-intervention (endline).        Caregiver reported symptoms were assessed at enrollment, midline, and endline; anthropometry was assessed 1 at midline and endline.

During this period, children are also at risk for undernutrition.              Beyond the acute morbidity and suffering caused by enteric infections and undernutrition, observational evidence       also suggests that repeated infections alone and in combination with undernutrition in the first years of life can       have lasting and detrimental effects on longer-term physical growth, cognitive development, and adult human capital.              The WASH Benefits studies provides rigorous evidence on the health and developmental benefits of water quality,       sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions during the first years of life. A cluster-randomized controlled       trial measured the impact of intervention among newborn infants in rural Kenya. The study is large in scope       (> 7,000 newborns) and has eight arms (six treatment arms and two control arms). Primary outcomes were measured after       two years of intervention.             Objectives: The goal of the WASH Benefits studies is to generate rigorous evidence about the impacts of       sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and development in the first years of       life. The WASH Benefits Kenya study is highly comparable to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh study; both cluster randomized       trials investigated the effects of the same six treatment arms.           The study has three primary scientific objectives:  Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and         development after 2 years of intervention. Determine whether there are larger reductions in diarrhea when providing a combined water, sanitation and handwashing         intervention compared to each component alone. Determine whether there are larger effects on growth and development from combining a) daily supplemental nutrition         with b) a combined water, sanitation and handwashing intervention compared to each component alone.   The study has three secondary scientific objectives: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Measure the impact of nutritional supplements and household environmental interventions on environmental enteropathy         biomarkers, and more clearly elucidate this potential pathway between environmental interventions and child growth and development. Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing and nutritional interventions on intestinal parasitic infection         prevalence and intensity. Measure the association between parasitic infection and other measures of enteric health, including acute diarrhea and environmental         enteropathy biomarkers.   The tertiary scientific objective of the study was to measure the impact of interventions on the following outcomes: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Weight-for-age at 1 and 2 years Weight-for-height at 1 and 2 years Underweight at 2 years Wasting at 2 years Severe stunting at 2 years Head circumference-for-age at 1 year and 2 years Soil-transmitted helminth infection at 2 years Protozoan infection at 2 years Verbal Communicative Development Inventory at 1 year WHO motor milestones at 1 year Acute respiratory illness All cause mortality      Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The trial was conducted in rural areas of 10 districts in Bungoma, Kakamega and Vihiga counties in the western        part of Kenya. The region is populated mainly by subsistence farmers. Unimproved latrine coverage is high (at least 85%). A pilot study in the region       estimated that among children <27 months old, 11% had diarrhea in the preceding 2 days. Very few (<5%) households had piped water and the majority of households        reported obtaining drinking water from sources where chlorination has previously been shown to be effective (such as protected springs).         Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - May 2014         Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6 treatment arms, a passive control arm, and a double-sized active control arm. Pregnant women        were enrolled, and outcomes were assessed in the children following 12 and 24 months of intervention.         Eligibility Criteria: The study communities must have met the following criteria:         Rural communities (defined as villages with <25% of residents living in rental houses, <2 gas/petrol stations and <10 shops) Not enrolled in ongoing water, sanitation, hygiene, or nutrition programs Most of the population relied on communal water sources and had unimproved sanitation facilities At least six eligible pregnant women in the cluster at baseline    Study Arms: Clusters were randomized to one of 8 study arms. Intervention delivery occurred within 3 months after enrollment of pregnant women, prior        to or as close to birth as possible. Compounds shared a latrine, so sanitation and handwashing interventions were delivered a the compound-level. Nutritional        interventions were delivered directly to the child participant within households.          Water quality: The study installed chlorine dispensers within the cluster boundary at public water sources used by study participants.          All community members were also able to use the dispensers. After filling their water collection container (typically a 20 L plastic jerry can) at the          source, users could place the container under the dispenser and turn a knob to release 3 mL of 1.25% sodium hypochlorite, an amount designed to yield          2 mL/L of free chlorine residual after 30 min for 20 L of water. The study also included community level promotion of dispenser use and all households          in the study compound received bottles of sodium hypochlorite (6 months' supply) to facilitate householders' water treatment during periods when they          rely on rainwater harvesting (common during the rainy season) or if they use a water source in which a dispenser has not been installed. Households were          visited monthly by community-based health promoters.  Sanitation: The sanitation intervention included three hardware components: (1) All existing latrines in the compound were          upgraded by installing a plastic slab with a tight-fitting lid. Households without latrines or with poor qualiity latrines were provided with         a new dual pit latrine. (2) Sani-scoop hoes dedicated to the removal of human and animal feces from the compound were provided to all households          in the compound. (3) Plastic child potties were provided to all households in the compound that had any children younger than 3 years. The behavior change components of         the intervention emphasized the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of feces in the compound courtyard to prevent         contact with young children. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Handwashing: The hardware components of the handwashing intervention included two handwashing stations installed in all households.          The first station was located in the kitchen (location of food preparation) and the other located near the toilet. Handwashing stations were constructed from locally available materials and included         a dual tippy-tap design with independent pedals attached to two 5 L jerry cans of clean water and soapy water. The study provided detergent soap to families          free of charge to replenish the soapy water bottles. The behavior change component of the intervention focused messaging for handwashing at two critical times:          after defecation and before food preparation. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing (WSH): Households received all three of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          and handwashing study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Nutrition: Mothers were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children through age 6 months. When newborns reached         6 months of age, mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding their children until 24 months, and received education about         supplementing breastfeeding with healthy complementary foods following infant and young child feeding best practice guidelines from         Unicef and         WHO.         From ages 6 - 24 months, study children received a daily lipid-based nutritional supplement (LNS) that has been developed and tested         through the iLiNS project. The study also provided LNS to older, age-eligible siblings (6-24 months)          living in study households to prevent potential sharing of LNS with older siblings. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing + Nutrition (WSHN): Households received all four of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          handwashing, and nutrition study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Double-sized active control arm: Households did not receive any intervention, but were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Passive control arm: Households did not receive any intervention and were not visited by community-based health promotors.   Units of Data Collection: Clusters consisted of 1 or more administrative villages; two or more neighboring may have been combined to create 1 cluster as        long as the cluster of villages had at least 8 eligible pregnant women and shared a border. Households were the family unit of parents and children, and compounds        were groups of households (typically 1-4 households from the same extended family). When multiple pregnant women from a single compound were eligible for        enrollment, more than one household may have been enrolled for that compound. Data about each compound were collected from households belonging to        that compound, and responses from various households about that compound's characteristics may differ.        Children who were born to the pregnant women initially enrolled in the study were        considered ""target"" children. Children aged <36 months living in the compound at enrollment and additional children born into study compounds after 6 months were        considered ""sibling/neighbor"" children.         Data Collection: A survey at enrollment (year 0, pre-intervention baseline) measured household socioeconomic characteristics and demographics (including maternal        age, maternal education, electricity access, type of floor, and number of people in the household), as well as water, sanitation, and handwashing infrastructure and behaviors        (including type of water source, reported water treatment, defecation location, type of toilet, and presence of water and soap at a handwashing station). Adherence to the        interventions was measured by surveying each enrolled household during unannounced visits 1 year post-intervention (midline) and 2 years post-intervention (endline).        Caregiver reported symptoms were assessed at enrollment, midline, and endline; anthropometry was assessed 1 at midline and endline.

The study has three primary scientific objectives:  Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and         development after 2 years of intervention. Determine whether there are larger reductions in diarrhea when providing a combined water, sanitation and handwashing         intervention compared to each component alone. Determine whether there are larger effects on growth and development from combining a) daily supplemental nutrition         with b) a combined water, sanitation and handwashing intervention compared to each component alone.   The study has three secondary scientific objectives: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Measure the impact of nutritional supplements and household environmental interventions on environmental enteropathy         biomarkers, and more clearly elucidate this potential pathway between environmental interventions and child growth and development. Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing and nutritional interventions on intestinal parasitic infection         prevalence and intensity. Measure the association between parasitic infection and other measures of enteric health, including acute diarrhea and environmental         enteropathy biomarkers.   The tertiary scientific objective of the study was to measure the impact of interventions on the following outcomes: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Weight-for-age at 1 and 2 years Weight-for-height at 1 and 2 years Underweight at 2 years Wasting at 2 years Severe stunting at 2 years Head circumference-for-age at 1 year and 2 years Soil-transmitted helminth infection at 2 years Protozoan infection at 2 years Verbal Communicative Development Inventory at 1 year WHO motor milestones at 1 year Acute respiratory illness All cause mortality      Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The trial was conducted in rural areas of 10 districts in Bungoma, Kakamega and Vihiga counties in the western        part of Kenya. The region is populated mainly by subsistence farmers. Unimproved latrine coverage is high (at least 85%). A pilot study in the region       estimated that among children <27 months old, 11% had diarrhea in the preceding 2 days. Very few (<5%) households had piped water and the majority of households        reported obtaining drinking water from sources where chlorination has previously been shown to be effective (such as protected springs).         Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - May 2014         Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6 treatment arms, a passive control arm, and a double-sized active control arm. Pregnant women        were enrolled, and outcomes were assessed in the children following 12 and 24 months of intervention.         Eligibility Criteria: The study communities must have met the following criteria:         Rural communities (defined as villages with <25% of residents living in rental houses, <2 gas/petrol stations and <10 shops) Not enrolled in ongoing water, sanitation, hygiene, or nutrition programs Most of the population relied on communal water sources and had unimproved sanitation facilities At least six eligible pregnant women in the cluster at baseline    Study Arms: Clusters were randomized to one of 8 study arms. Intervention delivery occurred within 3 months after enrollment of pregnant women, prior        to or as close to birth as possible. Compounds shared a latrine, so sanitation and handwashing interventions were delivered a the compound-level. Nutritional        interventions were delivered directly to the child participant within households.          Water quality: The study installed chlorine dispensers within the cluster boundary at public water sources used by study participants.          All community members were also able to use the dispensers. After filling their water collection container (typically a 20 L plastic jerry can) at the          source, users could place the container under the dispenser and turn a knob to release 3 mL of 1.25% sodium hypochlorite, an amount designed to yield          2 mL/L of free chlorine residual after 30 min for 20 L of water. The study also included community level promotion of dispenser use and all households          in the study compound received bottles of sodium hypochlorite (6 months' supply) to facilitate householders' water treatment during periods when they          rely on rainwater harvesting (common during the rainy season) or if they use a water source in which a dispenser has not been installed. Households were          visited monthly by community-based health promoters.  Sanitation: The sanitation intervention included three hardware components: (1) All existing latrines in the compound were          upgraded by installing a plastic slab with a tight-fitting lid. Households without latrines or with poor qualiity latrines were provided with         a new dual pit latrine. (2) Sani-scoop hoes dedicated to the removal of human and animal feces from the compound were provided to all households          in the compound. (3) Plastic child potties were provided to all households in the compound that had any children younger than 3 years. The behavior change components of         the intervention emphasized the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of feces in the compound courtyard to prevent         contact with young children. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Handwashing: The hardware components of the handwashing intervention included two handwashing stations installed in all households.          The first station was located in the kitchen (location of food preparation) and the other located near the toilet. Handwashing stations were constructed from locally available materials and included         a dual tippy-tap design with independent pedals attached to two 5 L jerry cans of clean water and soapy water. The study provided detergent soap to families          free of charge to replenish the soapy water bottles. The behavior change component of the intervention focused messaging for handwashing at two critical times:          after defecation and before food preparation. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing (WSH): Households received all three of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          and handwashing study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Nutrition: Mothers were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children through age 6 months. When newborns reached         6 months of age, mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding their children until 24 months, and received education about         supplementing breastfeeding with healthy complementary foods following infant and young child feeding best practice guidelines from         Unicef and         WHO.         From ages 6 - 24 months, study children received a daily lipid-based nutritional supplement (LNS) that has been developed and tested         through the iLiNS project. The study also provided LNS to older, age-eligible siblings (6-24 months)          living in study households to prevent potential sharing of LNS with older siblings. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing + Nutrition (WSHN): Households received all four of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          handwashing, and nutrition study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Double-sized active control arm: Households did not receive any intervention, but were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Passive control arm: Households did not receive any intervention and were not visited by community-based health promotors.   Units of Data Collection: Clusters consisted of 1 or more administrative villages; two or more neighboring may have been combined to create 1 cluster as        long as the cluster of villages had at least 8 eligible pregnant women and shared a border. Households were the family unit of parents and children, and compounds        were groups of households (typically 1-4 households from the same extended family). When multiple pregnant women from a single compound were eligible for        enrollment, more than one household may have been enrolled for that compound. Data about each compound were collected from households belonging to        that compound, and responses from various households about that compound's characteristics may differ.        Children who were born to the pregnant women initially enrolled in the study were        considered ""target"" children. Children aged <36 months living in the compound at enrollment and additional children born into study compounds after 6 months were        considered ""sibling/neighbor"" children.         Data Collection: A survey at enrollment (year 0, pre-intervention baseline) measured household socioeconomic characteristics and demographics (including maternal        age, maternal education, electricity access, type of floor, and number of people in the household), as well as water, sanitation, and handwashing infrastructure and behaviors        (including type of water source, reported water treatment, defecation location, type of toilet, and presence of water and soap at a handwashing station). Adherence to the        interventions was measured by surveying each enrolled household during unannounced visits 1 year post-intervention (midline) and 2 years post-intervention (endline).        Caregiver reported symptoms were assessed at enrollment, midline, and endline; anthropometry was assessed 1 at midline and endline.

Ethics Statement: The study protocol was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California, Berkeley        (protocol number 2011-09-3654), the institutional review board at Stanford University (IRB-23310), and the scientific and ethics review unit at       the Kenya Medical Research Institute (protocol number SSC-2271). Under direction of the study investigators, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA)        was responsible for intervention delivery and data collection.  Participants gave written informed consent before enrollment.        Last Updated: March 8, 2021WASH Benefits Kenya was a cluster-randomized trial that assessed improvements in water quality, sanitation, handwashing (WASH interventions) and child nutrition on the primary outcomes of child growth and diarrhea. Geographically matched clusters (groups of household compounds) were randomized to one of six intervention arms (1. water quality, 2. sanitation, 3. handwashing, 4. nutrition, 5. combined water quality + sanitation + handwashing, and 6. combined water quality + sanitation + handwashing + nutrition) or two control arms (1. active, and 2. passive). Newborns from rural households in Kenya were enrolled and outcomes were measured at 12 and 24 months after intervention delivery."	Data cleaning

During this period, children are also at risk for undernutrition.              Beyond the acute morbidity and suffering caused by enteric infections and undernutrition, observational evidence       also suggests that repeated infections alone and in combination with undernutrition in the first years of life can       have lasting and detrimental effects on longer-term physical growth, cognitive development, and adult human capital.              The WASH Benefits studies provides rigorous evidence on the health and developmental benefits of water quality,       sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions during the first years of life. A cluster-randomized controlled       trial measured the impact of intervention among newborn infants in rural Kenya.

Water quality: The study installed chlorine dispensers within the cluster boundary at public water sources used by study participants.          All community members were also able to use the dispensers. After filling their water collection container (typically a 20 L plastic jerry can) at the          source, users could place the container under the dispenser and turn a knob to release 3 mL of 1.25% sodium hypochlorite, an amount designed to yield          2 mL/L of free chlorine residual after 30 min for 20 L of water. The study also included community level promotion of dispenser use and all households          in the study compound received bottles of sodium hypochlorite (6 months' supply) to facilitate householders' water treatment during periods when they          rely on rainwater harvesting (common during the rainy season) or if they use a water source in which a dispenser has not been installed. Households were          visited monthly by community-based health promoters.  Sanitation: The sanitation intervention included three hardware components: (1) All existing latrines in the compound were          upgraded by installing a plastic slab with a tight-fitting lid. Households without latrines or with poor qualiity latrines were provided with         a new dual pit latrine. (2) Sani-scoop hoes dedicated to the removal of human and animal feces from the compound were provided to all households          in the compound. (3) Plastic child potties were provided to all households in the compound that had any children younger than 3 years. The behavior change components of         the intervention emphasized the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of feces in the compound courtyard to prevent         contact with young children. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Handwashing: The hardware components of the handwashing intervention included two handwashing stations installed in all households.          The first station was located in the kitchen (location of food preparation) and the other located near the toilet. Handwashing stations were constructed from locally available materials and included         a dual tippy-tap design with independent pedals attached to two 5 L jerry cans of clean water and soapy water. The study provided detergent soap to families          free of charge to replenish the soapy water bottles. The behavior change component of the intervention focused messaging for handwashing at two critical times:          after defecation and before food preparation. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing (WSH): Households received all three of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          and handwashing study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Nutrition: Mothers were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children through age 6 months. When newborns reached         6 months of age, mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding their children until 24 months, and received education about         supplementing breastfeeding with healthy complementary foods following infant and young child feeding best practice guidelines from         Unicef and         WHO.         From ages 6 - 24 months, study children received a daily lipid-based nutritional supplement (LNS) that has been developed and tested         through the iLiNS project. The study also provided LNS to older, age-eligible siblings (6-24 months)          living in study households to prevent potential sharing of LNS with older siblings. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing + Nutrition (WSHN): Households received all four of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          handwashing, and nutrition study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Double-sized active control arm: Households did not receive any intervention, but were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Passive control arm: Households did not receive any intervention and were not visited by community-based health promotors.   Units of Data Collection: Clusters consisted of 1 or more administrative villages; two or more neighboring may have been combined to create 1 cluster as        long as the cluster of villages had at least 8 eligible pregnant women and shared a border. Households were the family unit of parents and children, and compounds        were groups of households (typically 1-4 households from the same extended family). When multiple pregnant women from a single compound were eligible for        enrollment, more than one household may have been enrolled for that compound. Data about each compound were collected from households belonging to        that compound, and responses from various households about that compound's characteristics may differ.        Children who were born to the pregnant women initially enrolled in the study were        considered ""target"" children. Children aged <36 months living in the compound at enrollment and additional children born into study compounds after 6 months were        considered ""sibling/neighbor"" children.         Data Collection: A survey at enrollment (year 0, pre-intervention baseline) measured household socioeconomic characteristics and demographics (including maternal        age, maternal education, electricity access, type of floor, and number of people in the household), as well as water, sanitation, and handwashing infrastructure and behaviors        (including type of water source, reported water treatment, defecation location, type of toilet, and presence of water and soap at a handwashing station). Adherence to the        interventions was measured by surveying each enrolled household during unannounced visits 1 year post-intervention (midline) and 2 years post-intervention (endline).        Caregiver reported symptoms were assessed at enrollment, midline, and endline; anthropometry was assessed 1 at midline and endline.

Last Updated: March 8, 2021WASH Benefits Kenya was a cluster-randomized trial that assessed improvements in water quality, sanitation, handwashing (WASH interventions) and child nutrition on the primary outcomes of child growth and diarrhea. Geographically matched clusters (groups of household compounds) were randomized to one of six intervention arms (1. water quality, 2. sanitation, 3. handwashing, 4. nutrition, 5. combined water quality + sanitation + handwashing, and 6. combined water quality + sanitation + handwashing + nutrition) or two control arms (1. active, and 2. passive). Newborns from rural households in Kenya were enrolled and outcomes were measured at 12 and 24 months after intervention delivery."	Adherence assessment

During this period, children are also at risk for undernutrition.              Beyond the acute morbidity and suffering caused by enteric infections and undernutrition, observational evidence       also suggests that repeated infections alone and in combination with undernutrition in the first years of life can       have lasting and detrimental effects on longer-term physical growth, cognitive development, and adult human capital.              The WASH Benefits studies provides rigorous evidence on the health and developmental benefits of water quality,       sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions during the first years of life. A cluster-randomized controlled       trial measured the impact of intervention among newborn infants in rural Kenya. The study is large in scope       (> 7,000 newborns) and has eight arms (six treatment arms and two control arms). Primary outcomes were measured after       two years of intervention.             Objectives: The goal of the WASH Benefits studies is to generate rigorous evidence about the impacts of       sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and development in the first years of       life. The WASH Benefits Kenya study is highly comparable to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh study; both cluster randomized       trials investigated the effects of the same six treatment arms.           The study has three primary scientific objectives:  Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and         development after 2 years of intervention. Determine whether there are larger reductions in diarrhea when providing a combined water, sanitation and handwashing         intervention compared to each component alone. Determine whether there are larger effects on growth and development from combining a) daily supplemental nutrition         with b) a combined water, sanitation and handwashing intervention compared to each component alone.   The study has three secondary scientific objectives: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Measure the impact of nutritional supplements and household environmental interventions on environmental enteropathy         biomarkers, and more clearly elucidate this potential pathway between environmental interventions and child growth and development. Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing and nutritional interventions on intestinal parasitic infection         prevalence and intensity. Measure the association between parasitic infection and other measures of enteric health, including acute diarrhea and environmental         enteropathy biomarkers.   The tertiary scientific objective of the study was to measure the impact of interventions on the following outcomes: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Weight-for-age at 1 and 2 years Weight-for-height at 1 and 2 years Underweight at 2 years Wasting at 2 years Severe stunting at 2 years Head circumference-for-age at 1 year and 2 years Soil-transmitted helminth infection at 2 years Protozoan infection at 2 years Verbal Communicative Development Inventory at 1 year WHO motor milestones at 1 year Acute respiratory illness All cause mortality      Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The trial was conducted in rural areas of 10 districts in Bungoma, Kakamega and Vihiga counties in the western        part of Kenya. The region is populated mainly by subsistence farmers. Unimproved latrine coverage is high (at least 85%). A pilot study in the region       estimated that among children <27 months old, 11% had diarrhea in the preceding 2 days. Very few (<5%) households had piped water and the majority of households        reported obtaining drinking water from sources where chlorination has previously been shown to be effective (such as protected springs).         Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - May 2014         Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6 treatment arms, a passive control arm, and a double-sized active control arm. Pregnant women        were enrolled, and outcomes were assessed in the children following 12 and 24 months of intervention.         Eligibility Criteria: The study communities must have met the following criteria:         Rural communities (defined as villages with <25% of residents living in rental houses, <2 gas/petrol stations and <10 shops) Not enrolled in ongoing water, sanitation, hygiene, or nutrition programs Most of the population relied on communal water sources and had unimproved sanitation facilities At least six eligible pregnant women in the cluster at baseline    Study Arms: Clusters were randomized to one of 8 study arms. Intervention delivery occurred within 3 months after enrollment of pregnant women, prior        to or as close to birth as possible. Compounds shared a latrine, so sanitation and handwashing interventions were delivered a the compound-level.

Water quality + sanitation + handwashing + Nutrition (WSHN): Households received all four of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          handwashing, and nutrition study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Double-sized active control arm: Households did not receive any intervention, but were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Passive control arm: Households did not receive any intervention and were not visited by community-based health promotors.   Units of Data Collection: Clusters consisted of 1 or more administrative villages; two or more neighboring may have been combined to create 1 cluster as        long as the cluster of villages had at least 8 eligible pregnant women and shared a border. Households were the family unit of parents and children, and compounds        were groups of households (typically 1-4 households from the same extended family). When multiple pregnant women from a single compound were eligible for        enrollment, more than one household may have been enrolled for that compound. Data about each compound were collected from households belonging to        that compound, and responses from various households about that compound's characteristics may differ.        Children who were born to the pregnant women initially enrolled in the study were        considered ""target"" children. Children aged <36 months living in the compound at enrollment and additional children born into study compounds after 6 months were        considered ""sibling/neighbor"" children.         Data Collection: A survey at enrollment (year 0, pre-intervention baseline) measured household socioeconomic characteristics and demographics (including maternal        age, maternal education, electricity access, type of floor, and number of people in the household), as well as water, sanitation, and handwashing infrastructure and behaviors        (including type of water source, reported water treatment, defecation location, type of toilet, and presence of water and soap at a handwashing station). Adherence to the        interventions was measured by surveying each enrolled household during unannounced visits 1 year post-intervention (midline) and 2 years post-intervention (endline).        Caregiver reported symptoms were assessed at enrollment, midline, and endline; anthropometry was assessed 1 at midline and endline.

During this period, children are also at risk for undernutrition.              Beyond the acute morbidity and suffering caused by enteric infections and undernutrition, observational evidence       also suggests that repeated infections alone and in combination with undernutrition in the first years of life can       have lasting and detrimental effects on longer-term physical growth, cognitive development, and adult human capital.              The WASH Benefits studies provides rigorous evidence on the health and developmental benefits of water quality,       sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions during the first years of life. A cluster-randomized controlled       trial measured the impact of intervention among newborn infants in rural Kenya. The study is large in scope       (> 7,000 newborns) and has eight arms (six treatment arms and two control arms). Primary outcomes were measured after       two years of intervention.             Objectives: The goal of the WASH Benefits studies is to generate rigorous evidence about the impacts of       sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and development in the first years of       life. The WASH Benefits Kenya study is highly comparable to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh study; both cluster randomized       trials investigated the effects of the same six treatment arms.           The study has three primary scientific objectives:  Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and         development after 2 years of intervention. Determine whether there are larger reductions in diarrhea when providing a combined water, sanitation and handwashing         intervention compared to each component alone. Determine whether there are larger effects on growth and development from combining a) daily supplemental nutrition         with b) a combined water, sanitation and handwashing intervention compared to each component alone.   The study has three secondary scientific objectives: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Measure the impact of nutritional supplements and household environmental interventions on environmental enteropathy         biomarkers, and more clearly elucidate this potential pathway between environmental interventions and child growth and development. Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing and nutritional interventions on intestinal parasitic infection         prevalence and intensity. Measure the association between parasitic infection and other measures of enteric health, including acute diarrhea and environmental         enteropathy biomarkers.   The tertiary scientific objective of the study was to measure the impact of interventions on the following outcomes: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)  Weight-for-age at 1 and 2 years Weight-for-height at 1 and 2 years Underweight at 2 years Wasting at 2 years Severe stunting at 2 years Head circumference-for-age at 1 year and 2 years Soil-transmitted helminth infection at 2 years Protozoan infection at 2 years Verbal Communicative Development Inventory at 1 year WHO motor milestones at 1 year Acute respiratory illness All cause mortality      Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The trial was conducted in rural areas of 10 districts in Bungoma, Kakamega and Vihiga counties in the western        part of Kenya. The region is populated mainly by subsistence farmers. Unimproved latrine coverage is high (at least 85%). A pilot study in the region       estimated that among children <27 months old, 11% had diarrhea in the preceding 2 days. Very few (<5%) households had piped water and the majority of households        reported obtaining drinking water from sources where chlorination has previously been shown to be effective (such as protected springs).         Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - May 2014         Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6 treatment arms, a passive control arm, and a double-sized active control arm. Pregnant women        were enrolled, and outcomes were assessed in the children following 12 and 24 months of intervention.         Eligibility Criteria: The study communities must have met the following criteria:         Rural communities (defined as villages with <25% of residents living in rental houses, <2 gas/petrol stations and <10 shops) Not enrolled in ongoing water, sanitation, hygiene, or nutrition programs Most of the population relied on communal water sources and had unimproved sanitation facilities At least six eligible pregnant women in the cluster at baseline    Study Arms: Clusters were randomized to one of 8 study arms. Intervention delivery occurred within 3 months after enrollment of pregnant women, prior        to or as close to birth as possible. Compounds shared a latrine, so sanitation and handwashing interventions were delivered a the compound-level. Nutritional        interventions were delivered directly to the child participant within households.          Water quality: The study installed chlorine dispensers within the cluster boundary at public water sources used by study participants.          All community members were also able to use the dispensers. After filling their water collection container (typically a 20 L plastic jerry can) at the          source, users could place the container under the dispenser and turn a knob to release 3 mL of 1.25% sodium hypochlorite, an amount designed to yield          2 mL/L of free chlorine residual after 30 min for 20 L of water. The study also included community level promotion of dispenser use and all households          in the study compound received bottles of sodium hypochlorite (6 months' supply) to facilitate householders' water treatment during periods when they          rely on rainwater harvesting (common during the rainy season) or if they use a water source in which a dispenser has not been installed. Households were          visited monthly by community-based health promoters.  Sanitation: The sanitation intervention included three hardware components: (1) All existing latrines in the compound were          upgraded by installing a plastic slab with a tight-fitting lid. Households without latrines or with poor qualiity latrines were provided with         a new dual pit latrine. (2) Sani-scoop hoes dedicated to the removal of human and animal feces from the compound were provided to all households          in the compound. (3) Plastic child potties were provided to all households in the compound that had any children younger than 3 years. The behavior change components of         the intervention emphasized the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of feces in the compound courtyard to prevent         contact with young children. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Handwashing: The hardware components of the handwashing intervention included two handwashing stations installed in all households.          The first station was located in the kitchen (location of food preparation) and the other located near the toilet. Handwashing stations were constructed from locally available materials and included         a dual tippy-tap design with independent pedals attached to two 5 L jerry cans of clean water and soapy water. The study provided detergent soap to families          free of charge to replenish the soapy water bottles. The behavior change component of the intervention focused messaging for handwashing at two critical times:          after defecation and before food preparation. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing (WSH): Households received all three of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          and handwashing study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Nutrition: Mothers were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children through age 6 months. When newborns reached         6 months of age, mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding their children until 24 months, and received education about         supplementing breastfeeding with healthy complementary foods following infant and young child feeding best practice guidelines from         Unicef and         WHO.         From ages 6 - 24 months, study children received a daily lipid-based nutritional supplement (LNS) that has been developed and tested         through the iLiNS project. The study also provided LNS to older, age-eligible siblings (6-24 months)          living in study households to prevent potential sharing of LNS with older siblings. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Water quality + sanitation + handwashing + Nutrition (WSHN): Households received all four of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation,          handwashing, and nutrition study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Double-sized active control arm: Households did not receive any intervention, but were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.   Passive control arm: Households did not receive any intervention and were not visited by community-based health promotors.

Objectives:   Evaluate the impact of two azithromycin MDA regimens on infant mortality and other health outcomes, when provided in a rural West-African high-mortality context with an ongoing seasonal malaria chemoprevention program. Evaluate the effect of alternative MDA frequencies on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and host microbiota composition. Investigate the feasibility, acceptability and equity of alternative MDA strategies. Test hypotheses that azithromycin MDA eliminates malaria parasitaemia and reduces systemic and intestinal inflammation in asymptomatic children and to collect and store biological samples for assessing other possible mechanisms of azithromycin effect.    Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The LAKANA trial will be implemented in approximately 830 villages from 7-10 health districts in the Kayes, Kita and Koulikoro regions of Mali.        Dates of Data Collection: July 2020-July 2023 (anticipated)        Study Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial        Study Arms: LAKANA is a cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, three-arm clinical trial, with adaptive design. Participating villages will be randomly allocated to three different intervention groups in a ratio of 3 : 2 : 4 (control : azithromycin quarterly : azithromycin biannually).        Data Collection: Within each village, consenting households will be visited quarterly (at 3-month intervals), nine times. At the first eight of these visits, 1-11-month-old eligible infants (age 29-364 days), for whom there is a consent for study drug provision, will be weighed and given a single dose of study drug (azithromycin mixture or respective placebo mixture). Household data collected will include a household composition survey, household assets survey, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) questionnaire. Individual level data include morbidity and mortality data, treatment information, and serious adverse events. In addition, biological samples will be collected from a sub-sample of participants to support mechanistic and AMR sub-studies.         Study Documentation:  Study protocol:  LAKANA protocol version 2.0, 2019-12-17   Case report forms: These will be made available once finalized        Standard operating procedures: SOPs and other supporting documentation will be made available for review once finalized          ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files will be provided to ClinEpiDB as Stata files. These datasets will be converted to txt files and merged by unique ID and redundant or administrative columns will be dropped from presentation on ClinEpiDB.org.

Objectives:   Evaluate the impact of two azithromycin MDA regimens on infant mortality and other health outcomes, when provided in a rural West-African high-mortality context with an ongoing seasonal malaria chemoprevention program. Evaluate the effect of alternative MDA frequencies on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and host microbiota composition. Investigate the feasibility, acceptability and equity of alternative MDA strategies. Test hypotheses that azithromycin MDA eliminates malaria parasitaemia and reduces systemic and intestinal inflammation in asymptomatic children and to collect and store biological samples for assessing other possible mechanisms of azithromycin effect.    Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: The LAKANA trial will be implemented in approximately 830 villages from 7-10 health districts in the Kayes, Kita and Koulikoro regions of Mali.        Dates of Data Collection: July 2020-July 2023 (anticipated)        Study Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial        Study Arms: LAKANA is a cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, three-arm clinical trial, with adaptive design. Participating villages will be randomly allocated to three different intervention groups in a ratio of 3 : 2 : 4 (control : azithromycin quarterly : azithromycin biannually).        Data Collection: Within each village, consenting households will be visited quarterly (at 3-month intervals), nine times. At the first eight of these visits, 1-11-month-old eligible infants (age 29-364 days), for whom there is a consent for study drug provision, will be weighed and given a single dose of study drug (azithromycin mixture or respective placebo mixture). Household data collected will include a household composition survey, household assets survey, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) questionnaire. Individual level data include morbidity and mortality data, treatment information, and serious adverse events. In addition, biological samples will be collected from a sub-sample of participants to support mechanistic and AMR sub-studies.

Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 (LH2171) has been reported to ameliorate the development of autoimmune diseases, such as collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalitis in mice and inhibit interleukin (IL)-6 production in antigen-presenting cells in vitro. Regulation of cytokine production by antigen-presenting cells might be critical for the anti-inflammatory function of LH2171 in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanism and contributing components of LH2171-mediated inhibition of IL-6 production are unclear. Here, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of LH2171 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, as a model of antigen-presenting cells, necessary for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. LH2171 significantly reduced LPS-induced expression and secretion of IL-6 and IL-1? cytokines. It also inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases (NF-?B/MAPKs). Moreover, LH2171 induced gene expression of several negative regulators of NF-?B/MAPKs. Among these regulators, A20 was strongly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels upon LH2171 treatment. The cell wall fraction of LH2171 also demonstrated a similar increase in A20 gene expression and exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. These results suggest that the cell wall may be one of the anti-inflammatory components of LH2171. Since cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effect of LH2171 was mediated by TLR2 signaling. Specifically, LH2171-mediated IL-6 suppression and A20 upregulation in wild-type macrophages were reversed and significantly reduced in TLR2 knock-out macrophages. These results suggest that LH2171 induces A20 expression via TLR2 signaling, inhibiting the activation of NF-?B/MAPKs and cytokine production in antigen-presenting cells. This might contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of LH2171 on autoimmune diseases.	Gene expression analysis

Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 (LH2171) has been reported to ameliorate the development of autoimmune diseases, such as collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalitis in mice and inhibit interleukin (IL)-6 production in antigen-presenting cells in vitro. Regulation of cytokine production by antigen-presenting cells might be critical for the anti-inflammatory function of LH2171 in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanism and contributing components of LH2171-mediated inhibition of IL-6 production are unclear. Here, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of LH2171 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, as a model of antigen-presenting cells, necessary for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. LH2171 significantly reduced LPS-induced expression and secretion of IL-6 and IL-1? cytokines. It also inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases (NF-?B/MAPKs). Moreover, LH2171 induced gene expression of several negative regulators of NF-?B/MAPKs. Among these regulators, A20 was strongly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels upon LH2171 treatment. The cell wall fraction of LH2171 also demonstrated a similar increase in A20 gene expression and exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. These results suggest that the cell wall may be one of the anti-inflammatory components of LH2171. Since cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effect of LH2171 was mediated by TLR2 signaling. Specifically, LH2171-mediated IL-6 suppression and A20 upregulation in wild-type macrophages were reversed and significantly reduced in TLR2 knock-out macrophages. These results suggest that LH2171 induces A20 expression via TLR2 signaling, inhibiting the activation of NF-?B/MAPKs and cytokine production in antigen-presenting cells. This might contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of LH2171 on autoimmune diseases.	Cell wall fraction analysis

Carbapenem-resistant determinants and their surrounding genetic structure were studied in Acinetobacter spp. from neonatal sepsis cases collected over 7 years at a tertiary care hospital. Acinetobacter spp. (n = 68) were identified by ARDRA followed by susceptibility tests. Oxacillinases, metallo-?-lactamases (MBLs), extended-spectrum ?-lactamases and AmpCs, were detected phenotypically and/or by PCR followed by DNA sequencing. Transconjugants possessing the bla NDM-1(New Delhi metallo-?-lactamase) underwent further analysis for plasmids, integrons and associated genes. Genetic environment of the carbapenemases were studied by PCR mapping and DNA sequencing. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for sepsis caused by NDM-1-harboring organisms. A. baumannii (72%) was the predominant species followed by A. calcoaceticus (10%), A. lwoffii (6%), A. nosocomialis (3%), A. junni (3%), A. variabilis (3%), A. haemolyticus (2%), and 14TU (2%). Fifty six percent of the isolates were meropenem-resistant. Oxacillinases present were OXA-23-like, OXA-58-like and OXA-51-like, predominately in A. baumannii. NDM-1 was the dominant MBL (22%) across different Acinetobacter spp. Isolates harboring NDM-1 also possessed bla (VIM-2, PER-1, VEB-2, CTX-M-15), armA, aac(6')Ib, aac(6')Ib-cr genes. bla NDM-1was organized in a composite transposon between two copies of ISAba125 in the isolates irrespective of the species. Further, OXA-23-like gene and OXA-58-like genes were linked with ISAba1 and ISAba3 respectively. Isolates were clonally diverse. Integrons were variable in sequence but not associated with carbapenem resistance. Most commonly found genes in the 5' and 3'conserved segment were aminoglycoside resistance genes (aadB, aadA2, aac4'), non-enzymatic chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA1g) and ADP-ribosylation genes (arr2, arr3). Outborn neonates had a significantly higher incidence of sepsis due to NDM-1 harboring isolates than their inborn counterparts. This study demonstrates the significance of both A. baumannii and other species of Acinetobacter in cases of neonatal sepsis over an extended period. Oxacillinases and bla NDM-1 are the major contributors to carbapenem resistance. The dissemination of the bla NDM-1 is likely linked to Tn125 in diverse clones of the isolates.

This study demonstrates the significance of both A. baumannii and other species of Acinetobacter in cases of neonatal sepsis over an extended period. Oxacillinases and bla NDM-1 are the major contributors to carbapenem resistance. The dissemination of the bla NDM-1 is likely linked to Tn125 in diverse clones of the isolates.

25	S-EPMC2782860	OmicsDI	Selection of parasites with diminished drug susceptibility by amodiaquine-containing antimalarial regimens in Uganda.	Amodiaquine (AQ) is paired with artesunate (AS) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in recommended antimalarial regimens. It is unclear how readily AQ resistance will be selected with combination chemotherapy.We collected 61 Plasmodium falciparum samples from a cohort of Ugandan children randomized for treatment with AQ-SP, AS-AQ, or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for uncomplicated malaria. In vitro susceptibility to monodesethylamodiaquine (MDAQ) was measured with a histidine-rich protein 2-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and potential resistance-mediating polymorphisms in pfmdr1 were evaluated.Parasites collected from patients treated with AQ-SP or AS-AQ within the prior 12 weeks were less susceptible to MDAQ (n = 18; mean of the median inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], 62.9 nmol/L; range, 12.7-158.3 nmol/L) than were parasites from those not treated within 12 weeks (n = 43; mean IC(50), 37.5 nmol/L; range, 6.3-184.7 nmol/L; P=.009) or only from those patients in the treatment arm that did not receive AQ (n = 12; mean IC(50), 28.8 nmol/L; range, 6.3-121.8 nmol/L; P = .004). The proportion of strains with polymorphisms expected to mediate diminished response to AQ (pfmdr1 86Y and 1246Y) increased after AQ therapy, although differences were not statistically significant.Prior therapy selected for diminished response to MDAQ, which suggests that AQ-containing regimens may rapidly lose efficacy in Africa. The mechanism of diminished MDAQ response is not fully explained by known mutations in pfmdr1.	1. Histidine-rich protein 2-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2.

30	E-GEOD-61150	OmicsDI	Aberrant DNA methylation in rhabdomyosarcoma	Many pediatric malignancies are embryonal in nature, and one hypothesis for the origin of embryonal tumors is that they arise from a defect in differentiation, either by an inability to terminally differentiate or a reversion to a pluripotent state. There is emerging evidence that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the transition from embryonic stem cell to a more committed cell fate, utilizing both de novo DNA methylation and poised ‘bivalent’ chromatin domains (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) to abolish pluripotency and gain lineage- and cell-type-specific characteristics as a cell differentiates. Thus inappropriate epigenetic silencing by aberrant DNA methylation of bivalent genes required for differentiation could lead to the uncontrolled cell growth observed in cancer. Our broad hypothesis is that aberrant DNA methylation in cancer is targeted to a non-random subset of critical pathways used in normal development. This dysregulation of the normal epigenetic program used in development promotes cellular proliferation and provides a mechanism to block differentiation in pediatric cancers, such as rhabdomyosarcoma. Examination of DNA methylation in fourteen human rhabdomyosarcoma patient samples using RRBS. In addition, RRBS was used to examine DNA methylation in one human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) forced to terminally differentiate by expression of the forced heterodimer MyoD~E12 (MDE). Lastly, RRBS was used to examine DNA methylation changes during normal differentiation in one primary human normal myoblast cell line	1. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) 2.

Extracellular matrix (ECM) is the protein- and polysaccharide-rich backbone of bacterial biofilms that provides a defensive barrier in clinical, environmental and industrial settings. Understanding the dynamics of biofilm formation in native environments has been hindered by a lack of research tools. Here we report a method for simultaneous, real-time, in situ detection and differentiation of the Salmonella ECM components curli and cellulose, using non-toxic, luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs). These flexible conjugated polymers emit a conformation-dependent fluorescence spectrum, which we use to kinetically define extracellular appearance of curli fibres and cellulose polysaccharides during bacterial growth. The scope of this technique is demonstrated by defining biofilm morphotypes of Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium, and their isogenic mutants in liquid culture and on solid media, and by visualising the ECM components in native biofilms. Our reported use of LCOs across a number of platforms, including intracellular cellulose production in eukaryotic cells and in infected tissues, demonstrates the versatility of this optotracing technology, and its ability to redefine biofilm research.	1.

Dyslipidemia is a major contributor to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary disease. Its role in the etiology of atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncertain.We studied 7142 men and women from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Framingham Heart Study who did not have prevalent AF at baseline and were not on lipid-lowering medications. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured using standard procedures. Incident AF during follow-up was identified from hospital discharge codes; review of medical charts; study electrocardiograms; and, in MESA only, Medicare claims. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of AF by clinical categories of blood lipids in each cohort. Study-specific results were meta-analyzed using inverse of variance weighting. During 9.6 years of mean follow-up, 480 AF cases were identified. In a combined analysis of multivariable-adjusted results from both cohorts, high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with lower AF risk (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.87 in those with levels ?60 mg/dL versus <40 mg/dL), whereas high triglycerides were associated with higher risk of AF (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.05 in those with levels ?200 mg/dL versus <150 mg/dL). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not associated with the risk of AF.In these 2 community-based cohorts, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total cholesterol were associated with the risk of AF, accounting for other cardiometabolic risk factors.

53	VDJ_4995411523885404651-242ac118-0001-012	VDJServer	T cell Receptor Repertoires Acquired via Routine Pap Testing May Help Refine Cervical Cancer and Precancer Risk Estimates	Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer and fourth leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. In low Human Development Index settings, it ranks second. Screening and surveillance involve the cytology-based Papanicolaou (Pap) test and testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV). The Pap test has low sensitivity to detect precursor lesions, while a single hrHPV test cannot distinguish a persistent infection from one that the immune system will naturally clear. Furthermore, among women who are hrHPV-positive and progress to high-grade cervical lesions, testing cannot identify the ~20% who would progress to cancer if not treated. Thus, reliable detection and treatment of cancers and precancers requires routine screening followed by frequent surveillance among those with past abnormal or positive results. The consequence is overtreatment, with its associated risks and complications, in screened populations and an increased risk of cancer in under-screened populations. Methods to improve cervical cancer risk assessment, particularly assays to predict regression of precursor lesions or clearance of hrHPV infection, would benefit both populations. Here we show that women who have lower risk results on follow-up testing relative to index testing have evidence of enhanced T cell clonal expansion in the index cervical cytology sample compared to women who persist with higher risk results from index to follow-up. We further show that a machine learning classifier based on the index sample T cells predicts this transition to lower risk with 95% accuracy (19/20) by leave-one-out cross-validation. Using T cell receptor deep sequencing and machine learning, we identified a biophysicochemical motif in the complementarity-determining region 3 of T cell receptor β chains whose presence predicts this transition. While these results must still be tested on an independent cohort in a prospective study, they suggest that this approach could improve cervical cancer screening by helping distinguish women likely to spontaneously regress from those at elevated risk of progression to cancer. The advancement of such a strategy could reduce surveillance frequency and overtreatment in screened populations and improve the delivery of screening to under-screened populations.  We included samples from White Hispanic women age 18 years or older. We excluded women who were HIV+, pregnant, had an intrauterine device, or had a sexually transmitted disease at the time of sample collection. We obtained samples across all cytology result categories: Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy (NILM, Normal), Abnormal Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS), Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL), and High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL). At Parkland Health and Hospital System (PHHS), the primary screening strategy is cytology alone with a reflex hrHPV test for women with an ASCUS cytology result. The test assays for positivity across 14 HPV types, and the ASCUS result category is divided into ASCUS/HPV- (negative for all 14 types) and ASCUS/HPV+ (positive for at least one type). An additional exclusion criterion was applied to women with a result of Normal, ASCUS/HPV-, and ASCUS/HPV+, and that is they were excluded if they had previously had cervical cancer or previous treatment of cervical pre-cancerous lesions.  We applied these inclusion and exclusion criteria in a quota sampling scheme to ensure adequate representation of women across all five result categories. We targeted a minimum of 100 samples total with a minimum of 15 samples in each category, and then rescued all samples meeting our criteria each week until all minimums were reached.  This research was supported by Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center Development Funds and by a charitable donation from Young Texans Against Cancer, both to LC and JT.	1. Pap testing 2.

Here, we present single-cell transcriptomic analysis of >100,000 viral antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from 40 COVID-19 patients. In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper cells and cytotoxic T helper (TH) cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2 and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (TREG). Importantly, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a strong cytotoxic TFH response was observed early in the illness, which correlated negatively with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Polyfunctional TH1 and TH17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells compared to influenza-reactive CD4+ T cells. Together, our analyses provide insights into the gene expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in distinct disease severities.

Patients and Methods: Patients with pathologic evidence of clear cell RCC and radiographic evidence of metastasis were enrolled in this single arm phase II trial and were treated with SAbR in single or three treatments, followed by HD-IL-2. Correlative studies involved whole exome and transcriptome sequencing, T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, cytokine analysis, and mass cytometry on patient samples and correlated the results with clinical outcomes.  Results: Thirty mRCC patients were enrolled. A median of 2 (range 1-3) metastases were treated with SAbR. ORR of non-irradiated lesions was 16%; 8% showed complete response. Median overall survival (OS) was 16 months. All 30 patients developed treatment-related, reversible adverse events (AEs), including 22 (73%) grade ≥3 and no grade 5 AEs. Although SAbR did not improve the ORR to HD-IL-2, SAbR to lung metastases correlated with higher progression-free survival (p=0.0165). Correlative studies indicate increased frameshift mutational loads and mast cells with decreased circulating tumor-associated T-cell clones and T-cell clonal expansion in the group that benefited clinically. Patients with higher regulatory T-cell (Tregs)/CD8+ T-cell ratios in both baseline tumor and periphery did not benefit from this regimen.  Conclusions: Adding SAbR did not improve the response rate to HD-IL-2 in patients with mRCC. Tissue analyses suggest a possible correlation between frameshift mutation and tumor immune infiltrates, and clinical outcomes.  Patients were eligible if they were ≥18 years old, could give informed consent, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and showed pathologic evidence of clear cell RCC and radiographic evidence of metastatic disease with at least two lesions with a combined diameter of >1.5 cm that were amenable to SAbR (minimum gross target volume ≥2 cm3). Patients who had received prior oncologic treatments had to be >14 days from their most recent surgery, radiation, immunotherapy, or any targeted agent. Adequate cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and hematologic organ function were required. Patients were excluded if they had any form of immunosuppression. Patients with brain metastases were allowed if the metastases had all been adequately treated with surgery or radiation.  Clinigen Inc.

However, our knowledge on in vivo persistence of transfused Treg is limited. Whether Treg transfusion leads to notable changes in the overall Treg repertoire and or whether longevity of Treg in the periphery is restricted to certain clones is unknown. Here we use T cell receptor alpha chain sequencing (TCRα-NGS) to monitor changes in the repertoire of Treg upon polyclonal expansion and after subsequent adoptive transfer. We applied TCRα-NGS to samples from two patients with chronic GvHD who received comparable doses of stem cell donor derived expanded Treg. We found that in vitro polyclonal expansion led to notable repertoire changes in vitro and that Treg cell therapy considerably altered peripheral Treg repertoire toward that of the infused cell product, to different degrees in each patient. Clonal changes in the peripheral blood were transient and correlated well with the clinical parameters. We suggest that T cell clonotype analyses using TCR sequencing should be considered as a means to monitor longevity and fate of adoptively transferred T cells.

85	ZENODO_4947813	Zenodo	Data from: Drivers of individual niche variation in coexisting species	1. Although neglected by classic niche theory, individual variation is now recognized as a prevalent phenomenon in nature with evolutionary and ecological relevance. Recent theory suggests that differences in individual variation across competitors can affect species coexistence and community patterns. However, the degree of individual variation is flexible across wild populations and we still know little about the ecological drivers of this variation across populations of single species and, especially, across coexisting species. 2. Here we aimed to (i) elucidate the major drivers of individual niche variation in natural communities and (ii) to determine how consistent this variation is across coexisting species and communities. 3. We analyzed natural patterns of individual-level niche variation in four species of coexisting generalist frogs across a wide range of tropical communities. Specifically, we used gut contents and stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) from frog species and their prey to quantify individual niche specialization. Then we combined data on local community structure, availability of prey, phylogenetic relationships, and predator-prey size models to test how this variation is related to four ecological factors which are predicted to be key drivers of individual specialization: intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, ecological opportunity (i.e., diversity of resources), and predation. 4. We found that the degree of individual trophic specialization varied by up to nine-fold across populations within the same species. This sizable variation in trophic specialization across populations was at least partially explained by gradients of density of competitors (both conspecifics and heterospecifics) and intraguild predation. However, the specific relationships between individual specialization and these ecological gradients were strongly species-specific. As consequences, the identity of the species with more individual variation changed among sites and there was typically no spatial correlation in the degree of individual specialization across co-existing species. 5. Our results show that individual niche specialization within and across species can be strongly context-dependent and that hierarchies of individual variation among coexisting species are not necessarily consistent across communities. Recent theory suggests that this pattern could lead to concurrent changes in competitive interactions across sites and thereby could play a key role in species coexistence at the landscape level. Our results suggest that individual variation across and within coexisting species has the potential to affect not only species coexistence at local communities, but also regional diversity patterns.

87	ZENODO_4310163	Zenodo	Mating under climate change: impact of simulated heatwaves on the reproduction of model pollinators (Dataset)	 Climate change is related to an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events such as heatwaves. It is well established that such events may worsen the current worldwide biodiversity decline. In many organisms, heat stress is associated with direct physiological perturbations and could lead to a decrease of fitness. In contrast to endotherms, heat stress resistance has been poorly investigated in heterotherms; especially in insects, in which the internal physiological mechanisms available to regulate body temperature are almost negligible making them sensitive to extreme temperature variations. Wild bees are crucial pollinators for wild plants and crops. Among them, bumblebees are experiencing a strong decline across the world. Therefore, the ongoing global decline of these insect pollinators partly due to climate change could cause major economic issues. Here, we assess how simulated heatwaves impact fertility and attractiveness (key parameters of sustainability) of bumblebee males. We used three model species: Bombus terrestris, a widespread and warm-adapted species, B. magnus and B. jonellus, two declining and cold-adapted species. We highlight that heat shock (40°C) negatively affects sperm viability and sperm DNA integrity only in the two cold-adapted species. Heat shock can also impact the structure of cephalic labial glands and the production of pheromones only in the declining species. The specific disruption in key reproductive traits we identify following simulated heatwave conditions could provide one important mechanistic explanation for why some pollinators are in decline through climate change.

80	ZENODO_7469919	Zenodo	Data from: 2-D sex images elicit mate copying in fruit flies	Although the environment is three-dimensional (3-D), humans are able to extract subtle information from two-dimensional (2-D) images, particularly in the domain of sex. However, whether animals with simpler nervous systems are capable of such information extraction remains to be demonstrated, as this ability would suggest a functional generalisation capacity. Here, we performed mate-copying experiments in Drosophila melanogaster using 2-D artificial stimuli. Mate copying occurs when naïve females observe the mating success of potential mates and use that social information to build their own mating preference. By replacing live demonstrations with (i) photos or (ii) simplified images of copulating pairs, we found that even crudely simplified images of sexual intercourse still elicit mate copying, suggesting that Drosophila is able to extract sex-related information even from a degraded image. This new method constitutes a powerful tool to further investigate mate copying in that species and sexual preferences in general.	Mate-copying experiments
