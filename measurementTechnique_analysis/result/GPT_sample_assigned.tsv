GEMS1 Case Control is the case control study preceding this follow-on study. GEMS1 HUAS/HUAS Lite Survey: Three community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Surveys conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1 case control study.    Background: The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) was a prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study of the burden, etiology, and adverse clinical outcomes of diarrheal diseases among children aged 0-59 months seeking care at health care facilities during a 36-month period at seven sites in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. GEMS1 aimed to elucidate the more clinically severe medically-attended diarrheal episodes to guide and prioritize efforts to prevent the most life-threatening and disabling illnesses. It is also important to characterize the ""less severe"" diarrhea (LSD) episodes for which care is sought at health care facilities, recognizing that even though there may be fewer adverse health consequences from these illnesses, the overall LSD burden could be greater because it is more common than ""moderate-to-severe"" diarrhea (MSD). Whether there are meaningful differences in the distribution of etiologies of LSD compared with MSD also must be understood to optimize diarrheal disease prevention and treatment. Therefore a one-year follow-on study designated GEMS-1A was conducted in which six GEMS sites performed simultaneous case-control studies of both MSD and LSD, and one GEMS site performed a case-control study of MSD only. At the time of these studies, no site had introduced rotavirus vaccine into its Expanded Program on Immunization for young infants.        Objectives: The objective of GEMS-1A was to determine whether the findings of GEMS were generalizable to episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD), which represent the majority of paediatric diarrhea in patients presenting to health-care centres. This study was designed to simultaneously examine MSD and LSD.                The primary outcomes of the GEMS-1A study were to characterize, for LSD in addition to MSD, the overall and pathogen-specific population-based attributable incidence and the pathogen-specific attributable fraction, and to assess the frequency of nutritional faltering and other adverse clinical consequences among children with these two diarrheal syndromes relative to the control population. The outcomes were assessed by site and age stratum, and across all sites for incidence and nutritional outcomes.        Methodology:  Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS-1A- four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).          Dates of Data Collection: October 2011- January 2013        Study Design: Case-Control study        Eligibility Criteria: Participants at each site belonged to a censused population serially updated for births, deaths, and migrations using a demographic surveillance system (DSS). For case enrollment, sites selected sentinel hospitals or health centers (SHCs) where DSS children sought care for diarrheal illnesses.         Cases: All children aged 0-59 months belonging to the DSS population at each site who sought care at a SHC during a 12-month period were screened for diarrhea (>3 loose stools during the previous 24 hours). Episodes eligible for inclusion as MSD were new (onset after >7 diarrhea-free days), acute (onset within the previous 7 days), and satisfied at least one of the following criteria for MSD:         Sunken eyes (confirmed by parent/caretaker as more than normal)  Loss of skin turgor (abdominal skin pinch with slow [even a brief instant] or very slow [>2 seconds] recoil)  Intravenous hydration administered or prescribed  Dysentery (visible blood in loose stools)  Hospitalized         The remaining new and acute diarrhea episodes were considered LSD. Note, in Kenya, almost no LSD cases presented to health centers, so LSD cases were not recruited.        Controls: For each case of MSD or LSD enrolled, we enrolled 1-3 community control children without diarrhea in the last 7 days, randomly selected from the site's DSS database within 14 days of the case. Controls were matched to each individual case by age, gender, and residence (same or nearby village or neighborhood as the case).         Data Collection: At enrollment, parents/primary caretakers of cases and controls underwent standardized interviews to solicit demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical information. GEMS staff measured the child's length/height. Medical management by clinicians at the SHC and clinical condition upon discharge were documented. A single follow-up home visit was performed ~60 days after enrollment to assess the child's vital status and repeat anthropometric measurements. At enrollment, each case and control provided fresh stool that was placed in cold storage and transport media according to the protocol. If antibiotics were to be administered to cases before stool was produced, two rectal swabs were obtained for bacterial culture pending passage of the whole stool for the remaining assays. With few exceptions, GEMS-1A utilized the same clinical/epidemiologic, microbiologic, data management, and analytic methods described for the GEMS1 36-month study of MSD alone.

It is also important to characterize the ""less severe"" diarrhea (LSD) episodes for which care is sought at health care facilities, recognizing that even though there may be fewer adverse health consequences from these illnesses, the overall LSD burden could be greater because it is more common than ""moderate-to-severe"" diarrhea (MSD). Whether there are meaningful differences in the distribution of etiologies of LSD compared with MSD also must be understood to optimize diarrheal disease prevention and treatment. Therefore a one-year follow-on study designated GEMS-1A was conducted in which six GEMS sites performed simultaneous case-control studies of both MSD and LSD, and one GEMS site performed a case-control study of MSD only. At the time of these studies, no site had introduced rotavirus vaccine into its Expanded Program on Immunization for young infants.        Objectives: The objective of GEMS-1A was to determine whether the findings of GEMS were generalizable to episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD), which represent the majority of paediatric diarrhea in patients presenting to health-care centres. This study was designed to simultaneously examine MSD and LSD.                The primary outcomes of the GEMS-1A study were to characterize, for LSD in addition to MSD, the overall and pathogen-specific population-based attributable incidence and the pathogen-specific attributable fraction, and to assess the frequency of nutritional faltering and other adverse clinical consequences among children with these two diarrheal syndromes relative to the control population. The outcomes were assessed by site and age stratum, and across all sites for incidence and nutritional outcomes.        Methodology:  Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS-1A- four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).          Dates of Data Collection: October 2011- January 2013        Study Design: Case-Control study        Eligibility Criteria: Participants at each site belonged to a censused population serially updated for births, deaths, and migrations using a demographic surveillance system (DSS). For case enrollment, sites selected sentinel hospitals or health centers (SHCs) where DSS children sought care for diarrheal illnesses.         Cases: All children aged 0-59 months belonging to the DSS population at each site who sought care at a SHC during a 12-month period were screened for diarrhea (>3 loose stools during the previous 24 hours). Episodes eligible for inclusion as MSD were new (onset after >7 diarrhea-free days), acute (onset within the previous 7 days), and satisfied at least one of the following criteria for MSD:         Sunken eyes (confirmed by parent/caretaker as more than normal)  Loss of skin turgor (abdominal skin pinch with slow [even a brief instant] or very slow [>2 seconds] recoil)  Intravenous hydration administered or prescribed  Dysentery (visible blood in loose stools)  Hospitalized         The remaining new and acute diarrhea episodes were considered LSD. Note, in Kenya, almost no LSD cases presented to health centers, so LSD cases were not recruited.        Controls: For each case of MSD or LSD enrolled, we enrolled 1-3 community control children without diarrhea in the last 7 days, randomly selected from the site's DSS database within 14 days of the case. Controls were matched to each individual case by age, gender, and residence (same or nearby village or neighborhood as the case).         Data Collection: At enrollment, parents/primary caretakers of cases and controls underwent standardized interviews to solicit demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical information. GEMS staff measured the child's length/height. Medical management by clinicians at the SHC and clinical condition upon discharge were documented. A single follow-up home visit was performed ~60 days after enrollment to assess the child's vital status and repeat anthropometric measurements. At enrollment, each case and control provided fresh stool that was placed in cold storage and transport media according to the protocol. If antibiotics were to be administered to cases before stool was produced, two rectal swabs were obtained for bacterial culture pending passage of the whole stool for the remaining assays. With few exceptions, GEMS-1A utilized the same clinical/epidemiologic, microbiologic, data management, and analytic methods described for the GEMS1 36-month study of MSD alone.

At the time of these studies, no site had introduced rotavirus vaccine into its Expanded Program on Immunization for young infants.        Objectives: The objective of GEMS-1A was to determine whether the findings of GEMS were generalizable to episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD), which represent the majority of paediatric diarrhea in patients presenting to health-care centres. This study was designed to simultaneously examine MSD and LSD.                The primary outcomes of the GEMS-1A study were to characterize, for LSD in addition to MSD, the overall and pathogen-specific population-based attributable incidence and the pathogen-specific attributable fraction, and to assess the frequency of nutritional faltering and other adverse clinical consequences among children with these two diarrheal syndromes relative to the control population. The outcomes were assessed by site and age stratum, and across all sites for incidence and nutritional outcomes.        Methodology:  Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS-1A- four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).          Dates of Data Collection: October 2011- January 2013        Study Design: Case-Control study        Eligibility Criteria: Participants at each site belonged to a censused population serially updated for births, deaths, and migrations using a demographic surveillance system (DSS). For case enrollment, sites selected sentinel hospitals or health centers (SHCs) where DSS children sought care for diarrheal illnesses.         Cases: All children aged 0-59 months belonging to the DSS population at each site who sought care at a SHC during a 12-month period were screened for diarrhea (>3 loose stools during the previous 24 hours). Episodes eligible for inclusion as MSD were new (onset after >7 diarrhea-free days), acute (onset within the previous 7 days), and satisfied at least one of the following criteria for MSD:         Sunken eyes (confirmed by parent/caretaker as more than normal)  Loss of skin turgor (abdominal skin pinch with slow [even a brief instant] or very slow [>2 seconds] recoil)  Intravenous hydration administered or prescribed  Dysentery (visible blood in loose stools)  Hospitalized         The remaining new and acute diarrhea episodes were considered LSD. Note, in Kenya, almost no LSD cases presented to health centers, so LSD cases were not recruited.        Controls: For each case of MSD or LSD enrolled, we enrolled 1-3 community control children without diarrhea in the last 7 days, randomly selected from the site's DSS database within 14 days of the case. Controls were matched to each individual case by age, gender, and residence (same or nearby village or neighborhood as the case).         Data Collection: At enrollment, parents/primary caretakers of cases and controls underwent standardized interviews to solicit demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical information. GEMS staff measured the child's length/height. Medical management by clinicians at the SHC and clinical condition upon discharge were documented. A single follow-up home visit was performed ~60 days after enrollment to assess the child's vital status and repeat anthropometric measurements. At enrollment, each case and control provided fresh stool that was placed in cold storage and transport media according to the protocol. If antibiotics were to be administered to cases before stool was produced, two rectal swabs were obtained for bacterial culture pending passage of the whole stool for the remaining assays. With few exceptions, GEMS-1A utilized the same clinical/epidemiologic, microbiologic, data management, and analytic methods described for the GEMS1 36-month study of MSD alone.

During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD).              At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study.        Objectives:  To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study. Mali and The Gambia recently introduced the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine.        Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018        Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study        Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.         Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria-  Age 0-59 months Belongs to the DSS Randomly selected from the DSS database  Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview.        Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. The parent/primary caretaker of each selected child was asked whether the child had diarrhea in the previous 7 days. If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where. An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage.  The child's vaccination card was examined and the dates that the child received vaccines against rotavirus, oral polio, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus containing vaccine, and the EPI center attended were recorded.

During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD).              At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study.        Objectives:  To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study. Mali and The Gambia recently introduced the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine.        Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018        Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study        Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.         Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria-  Age 0-59 months Belongs to the DSS Randomly selected from the DSS database  Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview.        Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. The parent/primary caretaker of each selected child was asked whether the child had diarrhea in the previous 7 days. If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where. An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage.

Last Updated: October 10, 2022During the course of the Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study, a Health care Utilization and Coverage Survey (HUCS) was conducted semiannually as part of the Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) at each VIDA study site. In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of children from three age strata was selected and the HUCS was conducted by the DSS team during their routine rounds. The goal of the survey was to assess rotavirus vaccine coverage and to determine where children in the DSS seek care for moderate-to-severe diarrhea."	Documentation on ClinEpiDB

During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD).              At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study.        Objectives:  To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study. Mali and The Gambia recently introduced the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine.        Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018        Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study        Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.         Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria-  Age 0-59 months Belongs to the DSS Randomly selected from the DSS database  Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview.        Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. The parent/primary caretaker of each selected child was asked whether the child had diarrhea in the previous 7 days. If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where. An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage.  The child's vaccination card was examined and the dates that the child received vaccines against rotavirus, oral polio, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus containing vaccine, and the EPI center attended were recorded.

The villages within each PHC catchment area were selected for surveying based on API, logistics, and representation across both the PHCs and their regional sub-centers. To achieve the study sample size, 50% of households in each village were selected using the Probability Proportion to Size (PPS) technique at random from the sampling frame provided by the ASHA in each village. Additional households were sampled on as needed basis to fulfill target enrollment numbers. All eligible consenting individuals from each selected household were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were defined as individuals between the ages of 1 and 69 years with no immediate health risks and apparent full comprehension of the study procedures.            Data Collection: Data were collected electronically using the REDCap Mobile Application on Samsung tablets. Answers to the household survey were given by one resident, most commonly the 'head of household,' followed by individual surveys administered in the local language to each individual resident of the household, consisting of a pre-tested, structured interview with mostly close-ended questions. Demographic information (age, gender, education, occupation), medical history (fever, episodes of malaria, antimalarial use in the past year, other complaints), travel history over the past two weeks, and data on use of malaria prevention methods (e.g., insecticide treated nets (ITNs), repellents, coils) were also obtained. Daily behaviors and practices were also surveyed, with a focus on those that may put individuals at risk of infection, such as participation in outdoor activities during the evening. Parents or caretakers responded to some questions on behalf of their child(ren) for questions where the child did not have the knowledge or understanding to provide an answer.

Objectives:   Determine the individual and village-level prevalence of Plasmodium infections (symptomatic, asymptomatic, and subpatent) in two districts of Meghalaya, India via RDT and PCR Identify risk factors for Plasmodium infection, including sociodemographic, environmental, behavioral, and geospatial factors    Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: West Jaintia Hills and West Khasi Hills districts, Meghalaya, India            Dates of Data Collection: April-November 2018; follow-up May-September 2019            Study Design: Community-based survey with resampling the following year            Eligibility Criteria: Barato PHC (primary health center) in West Jaintia Hills and Nonglang PHC in West Khasi Hills were chosen for sampling based on annual parasite incidence (API) relative to other PHCs within the districts. The villages within each PHC catchment area were selected for surveying based on API, logistics, and representation across both the PHCs and their regional sub-centers. To achieve the study sample size, 50% of households in each village were selected using the Probability Proportion to Size (PPS) technique at random from the sampling frame provided by the ASHA in each village. Additional households were sampled on as needed basis to fulfill target enrollment numbers. All eligible consenting individuals from each selected household were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were defined as individuals between the ages of 1 and 69 years with no immediate health risks and apparent full comprehension of the study procedures.            Data Collection: Data were collected electronically using the REDCap Mobile Application on Samsung tablets. Answers to the household survey were given by one resident, most commonly the 'head of household,' followed by individual surveys administered in the local language to each individual resident of the household, consisting of a pre-tested, structured interview with mostly close-ended questions. Demographic information (age, gender, education, occupation), medical history (fever, episodes of malaria, antimalarial use in the past year, other complaints), travel history over the past two weeks, and data on use of malaria prevention methods (e.g., insecticide treated nets (ITNs), repellents, coils) were also obtained. Daily behaviors and practices were also surveyed, with a focus on those that may put individuals at risk of infection, such as participation in outdoor activities during the evening. Parents or caretakers responded to some questions on behalf of their child(ren) for questions where the child did not have the knowledge or understanding to provide an answer. All households with enrolled study participants were also spatially mapped via Global Positioning System (GPS).

However, since the effectiveness of RACD is limited by the low sensitivity of point-of-care tests to detect low-density chronic infections that perpetuate malaria transmission, other approaches may be more effective.         Objectives: This cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in a low endemic setting to evaluate the impact of two reactive focal malaria interventions - reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA) and reactive focal vector control (RAVC). The objectives were to:          Evaluate the effectiveness of rfMDA, RAVC, and their combination to decrease malaria        transmission Evaluate the safety of rfMDA and RAVC, alone and in combination    Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Zambezi Region, Namibia        Dates of Data Collection: January 2017-December 2017        Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled open label two-by-two       factorial design trial        Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study intervention are shown below:          Study Arms: Fifty-six census enumeration area (EA) clusters were randomized to: 1) RACD or rfMDA, and 2) RAVC or no RAVC.          RACD: rapid diagnostic testing and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine        (AL) rfMDA: presumptive treatment with AL RAVC: indoor residual spraying using pirimiphos-methyl    Data Collection: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting the parasite reservoir in humans (rfMDA versus RACD), in mosquitos (RAVC versus no RAVC), and in both humans and mosquitoes (rfMDA plus RAVC versus RACD only) on the primary outcome of cluster-level cumulative incidence of locally acquired malaria cases, an intention-to-treat analysis was performed.              Interventions were administered to the target population within 500 meters of an index case, as randomized. Index cases were defined as passively detected malaria cases that were confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy, irrespective of origin (e.g. local or imported), who were confirmed to reside in or have stayed at least one night in study EA in the previous four weeks. Data on malaria incidence and epidemiological data such as demographics, residence location, travel history, and malaria prevention behavior were collected.               Field teams aimed to visit the index case household and eligible neighboring households within seven days but up to five weeks from the report of an index case, prioritizing households that were closest to the index case. To cover ≥80% of individuals or households within 500 meters of index cases, field teams aimed to deliver RACD or rfMDA to at least 25 individuals and RAVC (if indicated) to at least 7 households.               Epidemiological data were collected on password secured tablets with pre-coded questionnaires programmed in Open Data Kit (ODK version 1.23.3). Tablet data was uploaded to a secure, firewall- and password-protected server. During the RACD intervention and during the endline cross-sectional survey, consenting individuals received malaria RDT testing and a dried blood spot (DBS) was collected for laboratory testing.

Field teams aimed to visit the index case household and eligible neighboring households within seven days but up to five weeks from the report of an index case, prioritizing households that were closest to the index case. To cover ≥80% of individuals or households within 500 meters of index cases, field teams aimed to deliver RACD or rfMDA to at least 25 individuals and RAVC (if indicated) to at least 7 households.               Epidemiological data were collected on password secured tablets with pre-coded questionnaires programmed in Open Data Kit (ODK version 1.23.3). Tablet data was uploaded to a secure, firewall- and password-protected server. During the RACD intervention and during the endline cross-sectional survey, consenting individuals received malaria RDT testing and a dried blood spot (DBS) was collected for laboratory testing.

24	clinepidb_DS_f559aee789	ClinEpiDB	Namibia rfMDA RAVC Cluster Randomized Trial - EDA data for QA	"Background: In low-endemic malaria settings, screening and       treatment near malaria index cases (reactive case detection, RACD) is practiced for surveillance and response. However, since the effectiveness of RACD is limited by the low sensitivity of point-of-care tests to detect low-density chronic infections that perpetuate malaria transmission, other approaches may be more effective.         Objectives: This cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in a low endemic setting to evaluate the impact of two reactive focal malaria interventions - reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA) and reactive focal vector control (RAVC). The objectives were to:          Evaluate the effectiveness of rfMDA, RAVC, and their combination to decrease malaria        transmission Evaluate the safety of rfMDA and RAVC, alone and in combination    Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Zambezi Region, Namibia        Dates of Data Collection: January 2017-December 2017        Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled open label two-by-two       factorial design trial        Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study intervention are shown below:          Study Arms: Fifty-six census enumeration area (EA) clusters were randomized to: 1) RACD or rfMDA, and 2) RAVC or no RAVC.          RACD: rapid diagnostic testing and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine        (AL) rfMDA: presumptive treatment with AL RAVC: indoor residual spraying using pirimiphos-methyl    Data Collection: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting the parasite reservoir in humans (rfMDA versus RACD), in mosquitos (RAVC versus no RAVC), and in both humans and mosquitoes (rfMDA plus RAVC versus RACD only) on the primary outcome of cluster-level cumulative incidence of locally acquired malaria cases, an intention-to-treat analysis was performed.              Interventions were administered to the target population within 500 meters of an index case, as randomized. Index cases were defined as passively detected malaria cases that were confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy, irrespective of origin (e.g. local or imported), who were confirmed to reside in or have stayed at least one night in study EA in the previous four weeks. Data on malaria incidence and epidemiological data such as demographics, residence location, travel history, and malaria prevention behavior were collected.               Field teams aimed to visit the index case household and eligible neighboring households within seven days but up to five weeks from the report of an index case, prioritizing households that were closest to the index case. To cover ≥80% of individuals or households within 500 meters of index cases, field teams aimed to deliver RACD or rfMDA to at least 25 individuals and RAVC (if indicated) to at least 7 households.               Epidemiological data were collected on password secured tablets with pre-coded questionnaires programmed in Open Data Kit (ODK version 1.23.3). Tablet data was uploaded to a secure, firewall- and password-protected server. During the RACD intervention and during the endline cross-sectional survey, consenting individuals received malaria RDT testing and a dried blood spot (DBS) was collected for laboratory testing.

Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. Children and males were found to be at higher risk of malaria than older people and females. In 2017, we undertook a subsequent behavioral survey among 500 participants in 237 households of four of the medium and high malaria villages.         Objectives: Investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk.

Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. Our analyses showed that the rainy season and male gender were risk factors for malaria; in high malaria villages, young age was an additional risk factor, and indoor and outdoor spraying was protective compared to no spraying. We undertook a subsequent behavioral survey in four of the medium and high malaria villages in 2017 to investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk among 500 participants in 237 households. Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with sections on malaria history and use of mosquito protection; blood was collected for microscopy, a rapid malaria test, and PCR testing.

Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. Children and males were found to be at higher risk of malaria than older people and females. In 2017, we undertook a subsequent behavioral survey among 500 participants in 237 households of four of the medium and high malaria villages.         Objectives: Investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk.        Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Odisha, India        Dates of Data Collection: February-May 2017        Study Design: Cross-sectional survey        Eligibility Criteria: Participants must have been aged 12 months to 69 years. Pregnant women were excluded.        Data Collection: In a published survey around Rourkela in 2013-2014 (N=1307), malaria  prevalence was found to be 8.3%. Using these data, villages were divided into low (<2%), medium (2-10%) and high (>10%) malaria prevalence, and risk factors assessed by type of village. Our analyses showed that the rainy season and male gender were risk factors for malaria; in high malaria villages, young age was an additional risk factor, and indoor and outdoor spraying was protective compared to no spraying. We undertook a subsequent behavioral survey in four of the medium and high malaria villages in 2017 to investigate the behavioral aspects of malaria risk among 500 participants in 237 households. Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with sections on malaria history and use of mosquito protection; blood was collected for microscopy, a rapid malaria test, and PCR testing.

These surveys provide data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment.              Ideally 100% of patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhea would have received care at the hospital(s) or urgent care setting(s) participating in the study at the field site where cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea were counted and analyzed, designated henceforth as the ""sentinel health centers"". Because the catchment population at most of the sites was quite large and there are typically multiple sources of health care, it may be logistically impractical to maintain both surveillance for moderate-to-severe diarrhea and the ability to enroll patients into the case-control study at all the health care facilities that serve the population. Moreover, at each site some fraction of children would not reach a health care facility when they have moderate-to-severe diarrhea. If the HUAS indicates that the point estimate of patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhea treated at the sentinel health centers falls below 75%, measures were taken to try and increase this percentage by including additional health care facilities in the surveillance.        Objectives: Data from the GEMS1 1 HUAS/HUAS Lite surveys was used in different ways-        To optimize the surveillance for determining disease burden To perform data adjustments to account for the proportion of children with diarrhea who do not seek care at the health care facilities participating in GEMS surveillance To calculate population-based incidence rates To compare data between the different sites To assess public perception of the need for interventions to prevent childhood diarrhea   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS1, four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).          Dates of Data Collection: March 2007- December 2010; the HUAS survey was conducted at the beginning of the study and HUAS Lite was conducted twice a year over the course of the study.        Study Design: Community-based Cross-sectional Survey        Eligibility Criteria: From the census at each study site, updated by ongoing demographic surveillance, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). The census databases were as current as possible, in order to include recent births and to put children who have crossed an age group boundary in the appropriate group. The list defines the population from which the HUAS sample is drawn. Even with the updated list, there may be births between the time of preparation of the list and conduct of the survey, so that infants at the earliest ages may be somewhat underrepresented in the HUAS.              Each of the sites selected a random selection of approximately 400 eligible from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group, e.g., because of aging and higher mortality rates), and 370 eligible children from each of the two older age strata (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.        Data Collection: The interviewer went to the child's home and described the study to the selected child's parent or primary caretaker. If the parent or primary caretaker wished to participate, the consent form was read aloud by the interviewer in the local language and the parent/primary caretaker was given an opportunity to ask questions. Thereafter, s/he would either provide a signature or (if s/he did not know how to write) place a mark on the consent form (this could be an ""x"" or a fingerprint) in the presence of a witness (who would also sign the form) indicating his/her willingness to participate. The parent or primary caretaker received a copy of the signed consent form to keep and the original was stored in the regulatory files at the study site. The respondent was the child's primary caretaker. If a primary caretaker was not available, this was recorded and the interviewer tried to leave a message indicating when the interviewer would be likely to return. A total of 3 attempts were made to contact a primary caretaker after which time the child was considered a nonresponder.              The data collected from the ~60 questions asked include information about the household and family composition, occurrence of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. HUAS Lite contained a subset of questions from the longer HUAS survey. The HUAS questionnaire also provided an opportunity to query a representative sample of the population on their attitudes concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment. The survey may have been modified as appropriate for each site, while adhering to the main elements. In some countries, birth dates may not be known and it may be necessary to use an events calendar to estimate ages.              The questionnaires allowed the estimation of the ability of the sentinel health centers at each study site to capture at least 75% of the cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea within the 7-day eligibility period. The survey also made it possible to determine the true incidence of moderate-to-severe diarrhea at the end of the study period. If the child did not experience moderate-to-severe diarrhea during the past 14 days, then parents were asked hypothetical questions about their anticipated health care utilization should their child develop such an illness. This permitted a determination of the proportion of mothers who would use the sentinel health centers if their children had an episode of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in the future.Information on the respondents' perceptions about the danger of diarrheal diseases in children, their attitudes about the importance of developing vaccines and other interventions were also collected.

These surveys provide data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment.              Ideally 100% of patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhea would have received care at the hospital(s) or urgent care setting(s) participating in the study at the field site where cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea were counted and analyzed, designated henceforth as the ""sentinel health centers"". Because the catchment population at most of the sites was quite large and there are typically multiple sources of health care, it may be logistically impractical to maintain both surveillance for moderate-to-severe diarrhea and the ability to enroll patients into the case-control study at all the health care facilities that serve the population. Moreover, at each site some fraction of children would not reach a health care facility when they have moderate-to-severe diarrhea. If the HUAS indicates that the point estimate of patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhea treated at the sentinel health centers falls below 75%, measures were taken to try and increase this percentage by including additional health care facilities in the surveillance.        Objectives: Data from the GEMS1 1 HUAS/HUAS Lite surveys was used in different ways-        To optimize the surveillance for determining disease burden To perform data adjustments to account for the proportion of children with diarrhea who do not seek care at the health care facilities participating in GEMS surveillance To calculate population-based incidence rates To compare data between the different sites To assess public perception of the need for interventions to prevent childhood diarrhea   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS1, four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).          Dates of Data Collection: March 2007- December 2010; the HUAS survey was conducted at the beginning of the study and HUAS Lite was conducted twice a year over the course of the study.        Study Design: Community-based Cross-sectional Survey        Eligibility Criteria: From the census at each study site, updated by ongoing demographic surveillance, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). The census databases were as current as possible, in order to include recent births and to put children who have crossed an age group boundary in the appropriate group. The list defines the population from which the HUAS sample is drawn. Even with the updated list, there may be births between the time of preparation of the list and conduct of the survey, so that infants at the earliest ages may be somewhat underrepresented in the HUAS.              Each of the sites selected a random selection of approximately 400 eligible from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group, e.g., because of aging and higher mortality rates), and 370 eligible children from each of the two older age strata (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list.        Data Collection: The interviewer went to the child's home and described the study to the selected child's parent or primary caretaker. If the parent or primary caretaker wished to participate, the consent form was read aloud by the interviewer in the local language and the parent/primary caretaker was given an opportunity to ask questions. Thereafter, s/he would either provide a signature or (if s/he did not know how to write) place a mark on the consent form (this could be an ""x"" or a fingerprint) in the presence of a witness (who would also sign the form) indicating his/her willingness to participate. The parent or primary caretaker received a copy of the signed consent form to keep and the original was stored in the regulatory files at the study site. The respondent was the child's primary caretaker. If a primary caretaker was not available, this was recorded and the interviewer tried to leave a message indicating when the interviewer would be likely to return. A total of 3 attempts were made to contact a primary caretaker after which time the child was considered a nonresponder.              The data collected from the ~60 questions asked include information about the household and family composition, occurrence of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices. HUAS Lite contained a subset of questions from the longer HUAS survey. The HUAS questionnaire also provided an opportunity to query a representative sample of the population on their attitudes concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment. The survey may have been modified as appropriate for each site, while adhering to the main elements. In some countries, birth dates may not be known and it may be necessary to use an events calendar to estimate ages.

This permitted a determination of the proportion of mothers who would use the sentinel health centers if their children had an episode of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in the future.Information on the respondents' perceptions about the danger of diarrheal diseases in children, their attitudes about the importance of developing vaccines and other interventions were also collected.        Study documentation:    HUAS Questionnaire HUAS Lite Questionnaire   Last Updated: May 6, 2021       The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) 1 HUAS/HUAS Lite surveys were three community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Surveys (HUAS, HUAS lite, and HUAS lite - Kenya) conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1 case control study. These cross-sectional surveys provide data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention, and treatment."

Note that participants from Walukuba and Kihihi sub-counties were followed through June 30, 2016 while participants from Nagongera sub-county were followed for an extra year, through June 30, 2017.          Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with passive and active malaria case detection and entomological surveillance          Eligibility Criteria: All households in each sub-county were enumerated and mapped (households were defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) from January - June 2011. Using a computerized number generator, random samples of households from each sub-county were approached consecutively, and 100 households were enrolled per site from August - September 2011 into both the entomologic surveys and cohort studies if they met the following criteria:          At least one household resident 0.5-10 years of age At least one adult resident available for providing informed consent 300 households (100 per site) were enrolled Aug-Sept 2011 and an additional 31 households were enrolled Aug-Sept 2013 to replace households withdrawn during the 1st two years of follow-up           All children and up to one primary caregiver from each household were enrolled into the cohort study if they met the following eligibility criteria:          Documented age between 6 months and <10 years for children Full time resident of the household No intention to move out of the sub-county for the next two years Agreement to come to a dedicated study clinic located within the sub-county for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications administered outside this study Provision of written informed consent from parent or guardian           Cohorts were dynamic - all newly eligible children were enrolled and study participants reaching 11 years of age were excluded from further follow-up. Study participants were withdrawn from the study based on:          Permanent movement out of the sub-county Inability to be located for > 4 months Withdrawal of informed consent Inability to comply with the study schedule and procedures Child reaching 11 years of age A household was withdrawn when all cohort study participants from the household were withdrawn.  Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months. In subset of children starting in December 2014, routine blood smears were done every month.            Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted once a month in each household participating in the cohort studies. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot end of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning by field workers. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or ""other"") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. In a random subset of female Anopheles mosquitoes the proportion infected with sporozoites were measured using an ELISA technique.

Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months.

Using a computerized number generator, random samples of households from each sub-county were approached consecutively, and 100 households were enrolled per site from August - September 2011 into both the entomologic surveys and cohort studies if they met the following criteria:          At least one household resident 0.5-10 years of age At least one adult resident available for providing informed consent 300 households (100 per site) were enrolled Aug-Sept 2011 and an additional 31 households were enrolled Aug-Sept 2013 to replace households withdrawn during the 1st two years of follow-up           All children and up to one primary caregiver from each household were enrolled into the cohort study if they met the following eligibility criteria:          Documented age between 6 months and <10 years for children Full time resident of the household No intention to move out of the sub-county for the next two years Agreement to come to a dedicated study clinic located within the sub-county for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications administered outside this study Provision of written informed consent from parent or guardian           Cohorts were dynamic - all newly eligible children were enrolled and study participants reaching 11 years of age were excluded from further follow-up. Study participants were withdrawn from the study based on:          Permanent movement out of the sub-county Inability to be located for > 4 months Withdrawal of informed consent Inability to comply with the study schedule and procedures Child reaching 11 years of age A household was withdrawn when all cohort study participants from the household were withdrawn.  Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months. In subset of children starting in December 2014, routine blood smears were done every month.            Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted once a month in each household participating in the cohort studies. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot end of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning by field workers. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or ""other"") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. In a random subset of female Anopheles mosquitoes the proportion infected with sporozoites were measured using an ELISA technique.

Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study with passive and active malaria case detection and entomological surveillance          Eligibility Criteria: All households in each sub-county were enumerated and mapped (households were defined as any single permanent or semi-permanent dwelling acting as the primary residence for a person or group of people that generally cook and eat together) from January - June 2011. Using a computerized number generator, random samples of households from each sub-county were approached consecutively, and 100 households were enrolled per site from August - September 2011 into both the entomologic surveys and cohort studies if they met the following criteria:          At least one household resident 0.5-10 years of age At least one adult resident available for providing informed consent 300 households (100 per site) were enrolled Aug-Sept 2011 and an additional 31 households were enrolled Aug-Sept 2013 to replace households withdrawn during the 1st two years of follow-up           All children and up to one primary caregiver from each household were enrolled into the cohort study if they met the following eligibility criteria:          Documented age between 6 months and <10 years for children Full time resident of the household No intention to move out of the sub-county for the next two years Agreement to come to a dedicated study clinic located within the sub-county for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications administered outside this study Provision of written informed consent from parent or guardian           Cohorts were dynamic - all newly eligible children were enrolled and study participants reaching 11 years of age were excluded from further follow-up.

Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months. In subset of children starting in December 2014, routine blood smears were done every month.            Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted once a month in each household participating in the cohort studies. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot end of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning by field workers. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or ""other"") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys.

Using a computerized number generator, random samples of households from each sub-county were approached consecutively, and 100 households were enrolled per site from August - September 2011 into both the entomologic surveys and cohort studies if they met the following criteria:          At least one household resident 0.5-10 years of age At least one adult resident available for providing informed consent 300 households (100 per site) were enrolled Aug-Sept 2011 and an additional 31 households were enrolled Aug-Sept 2013 to replace households withdrawn during the 1st two years of follow-up           All children and up to one primary caregiver from each household were enrolled into the cohort study if they met the following eligibility criteria:          Documented age between 6 months and <10 years for children Full time resident of the household No intention to move out of the sub-county for the next two years Agreement to come to a dedicated study clinic located within the sub-county for any febrile illness Agreement to avoid antimalarial medications administered outside this study Provision of written informed consent from parent or guardian           Cohorts were dynamic - all newly eligible children were enrolled and study participants reaching 11 years of age were excluded from further follow-up. Study participants were withdrawn from the study based on:          Permanent movement out of the sub-county Inability to be located for > 4 months Withdrawal of informed consent Inability to comply with the study schedule and procedures Child reaching 11 years of age A household was withdrawn when all cohort study participants from the household were withdrawn.  Data Collection:   Household Surveys: Household surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment to collect information on household demographics, characteristics and socioeconomic factors.          Cohort Study Enrollment: At enrollment all child participants and their parent or guardian underwent a standardized evaluation including a medical history, physical examination, and collection of blood for hemoglobin measurement and thick/thin blood smear, and were provided with a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (ITN).          Cohort Study Follow-Up: Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinics open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill.                  For any participant presenting to the clinic with documented fever (tympanic temp >38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.                  Routine evaluations including thick blood smears and hemoglobin measurements were performed every ~3 months. In subset of children starting in December 2014, routine blood smears were done every month.            Entomological surveys: Surveys were conducted once a month in each household participating in the cohort studies. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot end of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning by field workers. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (A. gambia s.l, A. funestus, or ""other"") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. In a random subset of female Anopheles mosquitoes the proportion infected with sporozoites were measured using an ELISA technique.          Population Level Vector Control Interventions: Universal Long-lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN)campaigns were carried out in Walukuba in November 2013, Kihihi in June 2014 and Nagongera in November 2013. District wide indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide was conducted only in Nagongera. Administered December 2014 - February 2015, June - July 2015, November - December 2015 and June - July 2016. With 96.9%, 95.6%, 96.8% proportion of households sprayed respectively (data not available for June - July 2016).

7	clinepidb_DS_450c62c7d0	ClinEpiDB	Jilinde Costing Study of PrEP in Kenya	"Related studies:  JILINDE Prospective Cohort Study   Background:        In recent years, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been positioned squarely on the prevention agenda of many countries with a high burden of HIV. In 2016, the Kenya Ministry of Health, following the guidance of the WHO, revised the national ""Guidelines on Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treatment and Prevention of HIV Infection "" (NASCOP, 2016), and recommended the provision of PrEP to all individuals at substantial ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection. Subsequently, the government launched a national PrEP scale-up program in May 2017.               However, as the government of Kenya continues to scale up PrEP, there is limited knowledge on the cost of scaling up the use of oral PrEP among Key and Vulnerable Populations (KVPs). The Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project commenced in July 2016 with an overall objective of supporting the government of Kenya to scale-up oral PrEP across the country. Jilinde conducted this study to assess the cost of PrEP for various KVPs using various models of service delivery and geographic regions of Kenya.              In this study we estimated the cost of PrEP from two different perspectives: the service delivery perspective and the client perspective. The service delivery perspective involved collecting cost data from health facility managers and by type of service delivery model (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, public health facilities that have integrated PrEP into the existing services and private clinics or social franchise clinics). This was to enable an analysis of the average unit cost of PrEP, as well as an analysis of the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya 's existing prevention strategy among KVPs. The output of the activity is an estimate of cost per person year (PPY) of service delivery. The second perspective involved measuring costs borne by the clients (financial and opportunity costs). By understanding what costs are incurred by the clients, it is then possible to better understand if these costs represent a significant barrier to PrEP uptake.               In addition, the costing study also examined the client willingness to pay for oral PrEP services (medications, laboratory procedures, etc.). This contingent valuation analysis was critical in not only understanding how much clients are willing to pay, but also to better understand the factors that cause clients to have greater or lesser motivation to seek out these services.         Objectives: The aim of the study was to estimate the full cost and unit cost of the PrEP scale-up program for different KVPs in Kenya.          Specific objectives:     To determine the current unit costs of providing PrEP by mode of service delivery (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, private sector and social franchise clinics and public health facilities) for various KVPs and geographic regions of Kenya; To estimate direct costs incurred by clients (financial and opportunity costs) in accessing PrEP;  To analyze the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya's existing prevention strategy among KVPs;  To determine willingness to pay for PrEP services.   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Data was collected from ten counties in Kenya where the Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project was implemented. The counties were clustered based on geographical proximity; Nairobi cluster (Nairobi, Kiambu, and Machakos); Coast cluster (Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, and Taita Taveta); Lake cluster (Kisumu, Kisii and Migori counties).  Dates of Data Collection: Data were collected from October 2017 to August 2018.        Study Design: This was a cross-sectional study that collected both quantitative and qualitative data through surveys with PrEP clients and key informant interviews with health facility managers.  Eligibility Criteria:           For the health facility costing, the study population included all public and private health facilities and community drop in centres in the three regions (Coast cluster, Lake Cluster and Nairobi Cluster) which had integrated PrEP services. Respondents were the health facility managers.            For the client costing survey, the study population included female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM) and adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) who had initiated PrEP through the different facilities supported by the Jilinde project. For the willingness to pay survey, the study population included clients (FSW, MSM and AGYW) who had initiated PrEP and those who had been offered PrEP services but had declined.        Data Collection:           Costing and utilisation data were collected from a sample of 44 facilities consisting of 23 public health facilities (County Referral Hospital, Sub-County Hospital, Health Centres and Dispensaries), 5 private facilities/clinics and 16 drop-in centres (DICEs). Six research assistants (two for each cluster), and the study investigators were responsible for data collection in all the sampled facilities.            For the facility costing, the study team conducted a semi-structured in-depth interview with facility managers to obtain information on the costs of resources used in delivering PrEP services. Data on all resources used in delivering PrEP services (personnel, equipment, medications, consumables, lab tests and reagents, test kits, utility, maintenance, and utilities) was collected for each visit (initial visit or first contact, refill visits and revisits) and for each stage of client flow in a facility: i) Reception, ii) Triage, iii) Health education, iv) HTS and STI testing, v) Prescription of drugs and vi) Dispensing drugs client). This service delivery process was useful in assisting the research team obtain relevant data for PrEP costing at each stage.             The client costing and willingness to pay data were collected through a structured, exit interview questionnaire, which was administered by the six Research Assistants at each of the 44 service delivery sites. PrEP clients were informed about the study by service providers, and those who expressed interest were referred to the research team within the facility, who screened for eligibility and administered consent. The research assistants documented whether it was an initial or follow-up refill or monitoring visit.           The client costing questionnaire was designed to gather, among others, demographic and socio-economic data, direct cost of accessing PrEP services (out-of-pocket expenses), and indirect cost in the form of productivity loss by the client (opportunity cost) when seeking services. The willingness to pay (WTP) questionnaire documented the participants personal and household characteristics (age, religion, marital status, individual income, household income, level of education, employment status, etc.), their willingness to pay for PrEP services, and reasons informing their decisions. Respondents who indicated a willingness to pay were shown 14 random payment cards, with various amounts, which varied from Kshs 0 to Kshs 10,000 (US$100) and asked to indicate which card represented the highest amount they would be willing to pay on a monthly basis for PrEP services.  Once an amount was selected, they were then shown the card with the next highest amount and asked if they would pay that amount.  If the respondent indicated ""no"", then the original amount selected would be identified as the maximum WTP.  If the respondent indicated ""yes"", then the next highest card was selected, and they were again asked if they would be willing to pay this amount.  In this way, the respondent is ""bid up"" until they confirm that the amount indicated is truly the maximum WTP.  After two attempts to ""bid up"" the respondent, the bidding process ended, and the highest amount was confirmed.       Study Documentation:  Questionnaire 1:  Client questionnaire Questionnaire 2:  Client WTP questionnaire Questionnaire 3:  Facility Questionnaire     ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as cleaned .csv files with all personal identifiers removed. All dates were obfuscated per individual through the application of a random number algorithm that shifted dates no more than seven days to comply with the ethical conduct of human subjects research.        Financial Support: The Jilinde project was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under investment number INV-007340. In addition, the project received a donation of PrEP commodities (TDF/FTC) from Gilead sciences.         Ethics Statement: Ethical approvals for this study were obtained from:   Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Scientific Ethics Review Unit (Non KEMRI 583)  Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) institutional review boards (IRB 7657).

In 2016, the Kenya Ministry of Health, following the guidance of the WHO, revised the national ""Guidelines on Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treatment and Prevention of HIV Infection "" (NASCOP, 2016), and recommended the provision of PrEP to all individuals at substantial ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection. Subsequently, the government launched a national PrEP scale-up program in May 2017.               However, as the government of Kenya continues to scale up PrEP, there is limited knowledge on the cost of scaling up the use of oral PrEP among Key and Vulnerable Populations (KVPs). The Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project commenced in July 2016 with an overall objective of supporting the government of Kenya to scale-up oral PrEP across the country. Jilinde conducted this study to assess the cost of PrEP for various KVPs using various models of service delivery and geographic regions of Kenya.              In this study we estimated the cost of PrEP from two different perspectives: the service delivery perspective and the client perspective. The service delivery perspective involved collecting cost data from health facility managers and by type of service delivery model (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, public health facilities that have integrated PrEP into the existing services and private clinics or social franchise clinics). This was to enable an analysis of the average unit cost of PrEP, as well as an analysis of the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya 's existing prevention strategy among KVPs. The output of the activity is an estimate of cost per person year (PPY) of service delivery. The second perspective involved measuring costs borne by the clients (financial and opportunity costs). By understanding what costs are incurred by the clients, it is then possible to better understand if these costs represent a significant barrier to PrEP uptake.               In addition, the costing study also examined the client willingness to pay for oral PrEP services (medications, laboratory procedures, etc.). This contingent valuation analysis was critical in not only understanding how much clients are willing to pay, but also to better understand the factors that cause clients to have greater or lesser motivation to seek out these services.         Objectives: The aim of the study was to estimate the full cost and unit cost of the PrEP scale-up program for different KVPs in Kenya.          Specific objectives:     To determine the current unit costs of providing PrEP by mode of service delivery (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, private sector and social franchise clinics and public health facilities) for various KVPs and geographic regions of Kenya; To estimate direct costs incurred by clients (financial and opportunity costs) in accessing PrEP;  To analyze the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya's existing prevention strategy among KVPs;  To determine willingness to pay for PrEP services.   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Data was collected from ten counties in Kenya where the Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project was implemented. The counties were clustered based on geographical proximity; Nairobi cluster (Nairobi, Kiambu, and Machakos); Coast cluster (Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, and Taita Taveta); Lake cluster (Kisumu, Kisii and Migori counties).  Dates of Data Collection: Data were collected from October 2017 to August 2018.        Study Design: This was a cross-sectional study that collected both quantitative and qualitative data through surveys with PrEP clients and key informant interviews with health facility managers.  Eligibility Criteria:           For the health facility costing, the study population included all public and private health facilities and community drop in centres in the three regions (Coast cluster, Lake Cluster and Nairobi Cluster) which had integrated PrEP services. Respondents were the health facility managers.            For the client costing survey, the study population included female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM) and adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) who had initiated PrEP through the different facilities supported by the Jilinde project. For the willingness to pay survey, the study population included clients (FSW, MSM and AGYW) who had initiated PrEP and those who had been offered PrEP services but had declined.        Data Collection:           Costing and utilisation data were collected from a sample of 44 facilities consisting of 23 public health facilities (County Referral Hospital, Sub-County Hospital, Health Centres and Dispensaries), 5 private facilities/clinics and 16 drop-in centres (DICEs). Six research assistants (two for each cluster), and the study investigators were responsible for data collection in all the sampled facilities.            For the facility costing, the study team conducted a semi-structured in-depth interview with facility managers to obtain information on the costs of resources used in delivering PrEP services. Data on all resources used in delivering PrEP services (personnel, equipment, medications, consumables, lab tests and reagents, test kits, utility, maintenance, and utilities) was collected for each visit (initial visit or first contact, refill visits and revisits) and for each stage of client flow in a facility: i) Reception, ii) Triage, iii) Health education, iv) HTS and STI testing, v) Prescription of drugs and vi) Dispensing drugs client). This service delivery process was useful in assisting the research team obtain relevant data for PrEP costing at each stage.             The client costing and willingness to pay data were collected through a structured, exit interview questionnaire, which was administered by the six Research Assistants at each of the 44 service delivery sites. PrEP clients were informed about the study by service providers, and those who expressed interest were referred to the research team within the facility, who screened for eligibility and administered consent. The research assistants documented whether it was an initial or follow-up refill or monitoring visit.           The client costing questionnaire was designed to gather, among others, demographic and socio-economic data, direct cost of accessing PrEP services (out-of-pocket expenses), and indirect cost in the form of productivity loss by the client (opportunity cost) when seeking services. The willingness to pay (WTP) questionnaire documented the participants personal and household characteristics (age, religion, marital status, individual income, household income, level of education, employment status, etc.), their willingness to pay for PrEP services, and reasons informing their decisions. Respondents who indicated a willingness to pay were shown 14 random payment cards, with various amounts, which varied from Kshs 0 to Kshs 10,000 (US$100) and asked to indicate which card represented the highest amount they would be willing to pay on a monthly basis for PrEP services.  Once an amount was selected, they were then shown the card with the next highest amount and asked if they would pay that amount.  If the respondent indicated ""no"", then the original amount selected would be identified as the maximum WTP.  If the respondent indicated ""yes"", then the next highest card was selected, and they were again asked if they would be willing to pay this amount.  In this way, the respondent is ""bid up"" until they confirm that the amount indicated is truly the maximum WTP.  After two attempts to ""bid up"" the respondent, the bidding process ended, and the highest amount was confirmed.

Data on all resources used in delivering PrEP services (personnel, equipment, medications, consumables, lab tests and reagents, test kits, utility, maintenance, and utilities) was collected for each visit (initial visit or first contact, refill visits and revisits) and for each stage of client flow in a facility: i) Reception, ii) Triage, iii) Health education, iv) HTS and STI testing, v) Prescription of drugs and vi) Dispensing drugs client). This service delivery process was useful in assisting the research team obtain relevant data for PrEP costing at each stage.             The client costing and willingness to pay data were collected through a structured, exit interview questionnaire, which was administered by the six Research Assistants at each of the 44 service delivery sites. PrEP clients were informed about the study by service providers, and those who expressed interest were referred to the research team within the facility, who screened for eligibility and administered consent. The research assistants documented whether it was an initial or follow-up refill or monitoring visit.           The client costing questionnaire was designed to gather, among others, demographic and socio-economic data, direct cost of accessing PrEP services (out-of-pocket expenses), and indirect cost in the form of productivity loss by the client (opportunity cost) when seeking services. The willingness to pay (WTP) questionnaire documented the participants personal and household characteristics (age, religion, marital status, individual income, household income, level of education, employment status, etc.), their willingness to pay for PrEP services, and reasons informing their decisions. Respondents who indicated a willingness to pay were shown 14 random payment cards, with various amounts, which varied from Kshs 0 to Kshs 10,000 (US$100) and asked to indicate which card represented the highest amount they would be willing to pay on a monthly basis for PrEP services.  Once an amount was selected, they were then shown the card with the next highest amount and asked if they would pay that amount.  If the respondent indicated ""no"", then the original amount selected would be identified as the maximum WTP.  If the respondent indicated ""yes"", then the next highest card was selected, and they were again asked if they would be willing to pay this amount.  In this way, the respondent is ""bid up"" until they confirm that the amount indicated is truly the maximum WTP.

7	clinepidb_DS_450c62c7d0	ClinEpiDB	Jilinde Costing Study of PrEP in Kenya	"Related studies:  JILINDE Prospective Cohort Study   Background:        In recent years, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been positioned squarely on the prevention agenda of many countries with a high burden of HIV. In 2016, the Kenya Ministry of Health, following the guidance of the WHO, revised the national ""Guidelines on Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treatment and Prevention of HIV Infection "" (NASCOP, 2016), and recommended the provision of PrEP to all individuals at substantial ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection. Subsequently, the government launched a national PrEP scale-up program in May 2017.               However, as the government of Kenya continues to scale up PrEP, there is limited knowledge on the cost of scaling up the use of oral PrEP among Key and Vulnerable Populations (KVPs). The Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project commenced in July 2016 with an overall objective of supporting the government of Kenya to scale-up oral PrEP across the country. Jilinde conducted this study to assess the cost of PrEP for various KVPs using various models of service delivery and geographic regions of Kenya.              In this study we estimated the cost of PrEP from two different perspectives: the service delivery perspective and the client perspective. The service delivery perspective involved collecting cost data from health facility managers and by type of service delivery model (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, public health facilities that have integrated PrEP into the existing services and private clinics or social franchise clinics). This was to enable an analysis of the average unit cost of PrEP, as well as an analysis of the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya 's existing prevention strategy among KVPs. The output of the activity is an estimate of cost per person year (PPY) of service delivery. The second perspective involved measuring costs borne by the clients (financial and opportunity costs). By understanding what costs are incurred by the clients, it is then possible to better understand if these costs represent a significant barrier to PrEP uptake.               In addition, the costing study also examined the client willingness to pay for oral PrEP services (medications, laboratory procedures, etc.). This contingent valuation analysis was critical in not only understanding how much clients are willing to pay, but also to better understand the factors that cause clients to have greater or lesser motivation to seek out these services.         Objectives: The aim of the study was to estimate the full cost and unit cost of the PrEP scale-up program for different KVPs in Kenya.          Specific objectives:     To determine the current unit costs of providing PrEP by mode of service delivery (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, private sector and social franchise clinics and public health facilities) for various KVPs and geographic regions of Kenya; To estimate direct costs incurred by clients (financial and opportunity costs) in accessing PrEP;  To analyze the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya's existing prevention strategy among KVPs;  To determine willingness to pay for PrEP services.   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Data was collected from ten counties in Kenya where the Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project was implemented. The counties were clustered based on geographical proximity; Nairobi cluster (Nairobi, Kiambu, and Machakos); Coast cluster (Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, and Taita Taveta); Lake cluster (Kisumu, Kisii and Migori counties).  Dates of Data Collection: Data were collected from October 2017 to August 2018.        Study Design: This was a cross-sectional study that collected both quantitative and qualitative data through surveys with PrEP clients and key informant interviews with health facility managers.  Eligibility Criteria:           For the health facility costing, the study population included all public and private health facilities and community drop in centres in the three regions (Coast cluster, Lake Cluster and Nairobi Cluster) which had integrated PrEP services. Respondents were the health facility managers.            For the client costing survey, the study population included female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM) and adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) who had initiated PrEP through the different facilities supported by the Jilinde project. For the willingness to pay survey, the study population included clients (FSW, MSM and AGYW) who had initiated PrEP and those who had been offered PrEP services but had declined.        Data Collection:           Costing and utilisation data were collected from a sample of 44 facilities consisting of 23 public health facilities (County Referral Hospital, Sub-County Hospital, Health Centres and Dispensaries), 5 private facilities/clinics and 16 drop-in centres (DICEs). Six research assistants (two for each cluster), and the study investigators were responsible for data collection in all the sampled facilities.

Specific objectives:     To determine the current unit costs of providing PrEP by mode of service delivery (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, private sector and social franchise clinics and public health facilities) for various KVPs and geographic regions of Kenya; To estimate direct costs incurred by clients (financial and opportunity costs) in accessing PrEP;  To analyze the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya's existing prevention strategy among KVPs;  To determine willingness to pay for PrEP services.   Methodology:  Geographic Location/Study Sites: Data was collected from ten counties in Kenya where the Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project was implemented. The counties were clustered based on geographical proximity; Nairobi cluster (Nairobi, Kiambu, and Machakos); Coast cluster (Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, and Taita Taveta); Lake cluster (Kisumu, Kisii and Migori counties).  Dates of Data Collection: Data were collected from October 2017 to August 2018.        Study Design: This was a cross-sectional study that collected both quantitative and qualitative data through surveys with PrEP clients and key informant interviews with health facility managers.  Eligibility Criteria:           For the health facility costing, the study population included all public and private health facilities and community drop in centres in the three regions (Coast cluster, Lake Cluster and Nairobi Cluster) which had integrated PrEP services. Respondents were the health facility managers.            For the client costing survey, the study population included female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM) and adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) who had initiated PrEP through the different facilities supported by the Jilinde project. For the willingness to pay survey, the study population included clients (FSW, MSM and AGYW) who had initiated PrEP and those who had been offered PrEP services but had declined.        Data Collection:           Costing and utilisation data were collected from a sample of 44 facilities consisting of 23 public health facilities (County Referral Hospital, Sub-County Hospital, Health Centres and Dispensaries), 5 private facilities/clinics and 16 drop-in centres (DICEs). Six research assistants (two for each cluster), and the study investigators were responsible for data collection in all the sampled facilities.            For the facility costing, the study team conducted a semi-structured in-depth interview with facility managers to obtain information on the costs of resources used in delivering PrEP services. Data on all resources used in delivering PrEP services (personnel, equipment, medications, consumables, lab tests and reagents, test kits, utility, maintenance, and utilities) was collected for each visit (initial visit or first contact, refill visits and revisits) and for each stage of client flow in a facility: i) Reception, ii) Triage, iii) Health education, iv) HTS and STI testing, v) Prescription of drugs and vi) Dispensing drugs client). This service delivery process was useful in assisting the research team obtain relevant data for PrEP costing at each stage.             The client costing and willingness to pay data were collected through a structured, exit interview questionnaire, which was administered by the six Research Assistants at each of the 44 service delivery sites. PrEP clients were informed about the study by service providers, and those who expressed interest were referred to the research team within the facility, who screened for eligibility and administered consent. The research assistants documented whether it was an initial or follow-up refill or monitoring visit.           The client costing questionnaire was designed to gather, among others, demographic and socio-economic data, direct cost of accessing PrEP services (out-of-pocket expenses), and indirect cost in the form of productivity loss by the client (opportunity cost) when seeking services. The willingness to pay (WTP) questionnaire documented the participants personal and household characteristics (age, religion, marital status, individual income, household income, level of education, employment status, etc.), their willingness to pay for PrEP services, and reasons informing their decisions. Respondents who indicated a willingness to pay were shown 14 random payment cards, with various amounts, which varied from Kshs 0 to Kshs 10,000 (US$100) and asked to indicate which card represented the highest amount they would be willing to pay on a monthly basis for PrEP services.  Once an amount was selected, they were then shown the card with the next highest amount and asked if they would pay that amount.  If the respondent indicated ""no"", then the original amount selected would be identified as the maximum WTP.  If the respondent indicated ""yes"", then the next highest card was selected, and they were again asked if they would be willing to pay this amount.  In this way, the respondent is ""bid up"" until they confirm that the amount indicated is truly the maximum WTP.  After two attempts to ""bid up"" the respondent, the bidding process ended, and the highest amount was confirmed.

7	clinepidb_DS_450c62c7d0	ClinEpiDB	Jilinde Costing Study of PrEP in Kenya	"Related studies:  JILINDE Prospective Cohort Study   Background:        In recent years, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been positioned squarely on the prevention agenda of many countries with a high burden of HIV. In 2016, the Kenya Ministry of Health, following the guidance of the WHO, revised the national ""Guidelines on Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treatment and Prevention of HIV Infection "" (NASCOP, 2016), and recommended the provision of PrEP to all individuals at substantial ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection. Subsequently, the government launched a national PrEP scale-up program in May 2017.               However, as the government of Kenya continues to scale up PrEP, there is limited knowledge on the cost of scaling up the use of oral PrEP among Key and Vulnerable Populations (KVPs). The Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project commenced in July 2016 with an overall objective of supporting the government of Kenya to scale-up oral PrEP across the country. Jilinde conducted this study to assess the cost of PrEP for various KVPs using various models of service delivery and geographic regions of Kenya.              In this study we estimated the cost of PrEP from two different perspectives: the service delivery perspective and the client perspective. The service delivery perspective involved collecting cost data from health facility managers and by type of service delivery model (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, public health facilities that have integrated PrEP into the existing services and private clinics or social franchise clinics). This was to enable an analysis of the average unit cost of PrEP, as well as an analysis of the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya 's existing prevention strategy among KVPs. The output of the activity is an estimate of cost per person year (PPY) of service delivery. The second perspective involved measuring costs borne by the clients (financial and opportunity costs). By understanding what costs are incurred by the clients, it is then possible to better understand if these costs represent a significant barrier to PrEP uptake.               In addition, the costing study also examined the client willingness to pay for oral PrEP services (medications, laboratory procedures, etc.). This contingent valuation analysis was critical in not only understanding how much clients are willing to pay, but also to better understand the factors that cause clients to have greater or lesser motivation to seek out these services.

There are a few publicly available datasets of files with audio formats. Therewith, there is no public dataset for file fragments of audio file formats. So, a big research challenge in file fragment classification of audio file formats is to compare the performance of the developed methods over the same datasets. DATA DESCRIPTION:In this study, we present a dataset that contains file fragments of 20 audio file formats: AMR, AMR-WB, AAC, AIFF, CVSD, FLAC, GSM-FR, iLBC, Microsoft ADPCM, MP3, PCM, WMA, A-Law, µ-Law, G.726, G.729, Microsoft GSM, OGG Vorbis, OPUS, and SPEEX. Corresponding to each format, the dataset contains the file fragments of audio files with different compression settings. For each pair of file format and compression setting, 210 file fragments are provided. Totally, the dataset contains 20,160 file fragments."	Audio file splitting

31	S-EPMC6925457	OmicsDI	Dataset for file fragment classification of audio file formats.	"OBJECTIVES:File fragment classification of audio file formats is a topic of interest in network forensics. There are a few publicly available datasets of files with audio formats. Therewith, there is no public dataset for file fragments of audio file formats. So, a big research challenge in file fragment classification of audio file formats is to compare the performance of the developed methods over the same datasets.

48	S-EPMC4762910	OmicsDI	PPAR? activation following apoptotic cell instillation promotes resolution of lung inflammation and fibrosis via regulation of efferocytosis and proresolving cytokines.	"Changes in macrophage phenotype have been implicated in apoptotic cell-mediated immune modulation via induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?). In this study, we characterized PPAR? induction by apoptotic cell instillation over the course of bleomycin-induced lung injury in C57BL/6 mice. Next, the role of PPAR? activation in resolving lung inflammation and fibrosis was investigated. Our data demonstrate that apoptotic cell instillation after bleomycin results in immediate and prolonged enhancement of PPAR? mRNA and protein in alveolar macrophages and lung. Moreover, PPAR? activity and expression of its target molecules, including CD36, macrophage mannose receptor, and arginase 1, were persistently enhanced following apoptotic cell instillation. Coadministration of the PPAR? antagonist, GW9662, reversed the enhanced efferocytosis, and the reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression, neutrophil recruitment, myeloperoxidase activity, hydroxyproline contents, and fibrosis markers, including type 1 collagen ?2, fibronectin and ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA), in the lung by apoptotic cell instillation. In addition, inhibition of PPAR? activity reversed the expression of transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), interleukin (IL)-10, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). These findings indicate that one-time apoptotic cell instillation contributes to anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic responses via upregulation of PPAR? expression and subsequent activation, leading to regulation of efferocytosis and production of proresolving cytokines."

"Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 (LH2171) has been reported to ameliorate the development of autoimmune diseases, such as collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalitis in mice and inhibit interleukin (IL)-6 production in antigen-presenting cells in vitro. Regulation of cytokine production by antigen-presenting cells might be critical for the anti-inflammatory function of LH2171 in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanism and contributing components of LH2171-mediated inhibition of IL-6 production are unclear. Here, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of LH2171 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, as a model of antigen-presenting cells, necessary for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. LH2171 significantly reduced LPS-induced expression and secretion of IL-6 and IL-1? cytokines. It also inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases (NF-?B/MAPKs). Moreover, LH2171 induced gene expression of several negative regulators of NF-?B/MAPKs. Among these regulators, A20 was strongly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels upon LH2171 treatment. The cell wall fraction of LH2171 also demonstrated a similar increase in A20 gene expression and exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. These results suggest that the cell wall may be one of the anti-inflammatory components of LH2171. Since cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effect of LH2171 was mediated by TLR2 signaling. Specifically, LH2171-mediated IL-6 suppression and A20 upregulation in wild-type macrophages were reversed and significantly reduced in TLR2 knock-out macrophages. These results suggest that LH2171 induces A20 expression via TLR2 signaling, inhibiting the activation of NF-?B/MAPKs and cytokine production in antigen-presenting cells.

Specifically, LH2171-mediated IL-6 suppression and A20 upregulation in wild-type macrophages were reversed and significantly reduced in TLR2 knock-out macrophages. These results suggest that LH2171 induces A20 expression via TLR2 signaling, inhibiting the activation of NF-?B/MAPKs and cytokine production in antigen-presenting cells. This might contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of LH2171 on autoimmune diseases."	Knock-out study
45	S-EPMC4190575	OmicsDI	The roots of plant defenses: integrative multivariate analyses uncover dynamic behaviors of gene and metabolic networks of roots elicited by leaf herbivory.	"High-throughput analyses have frequently been used to characterize herbivory-induced reconfigurations in plant primary and secondary metabolism in above- and below-ground tissues, but the conclusions drawn from these analyses are often limited by the univariate methods used to analyze the data. Here we use our previously described multivariate time-series data analysis to evaluate leaf herbivory-elicited transcriptional and metabolic dynamics in the roots of Nicotiana attenuata. We observed large, but transient, systemic responses in the roots that contrasted with the pattern of co-linearity observed in the up- and downregulation of genes and metabolites across the entire time series in treated and systemic leaves. Using this newly developed approach for the analysis of whole-plant molecular responses in a time-course multivariate data set, we simultaneously analyzed stress responses in leaves and roots in response to the elicitation of a leaf. We found that transient systemic responses in roots resolved into two principal trends characterized by: (i) an inversion of root-specific semi-diurnal (12 h) transcript oscillations and (ii) transcriptional changes with major amplitude effects that translated into a distinct suite of root-specific secondary metabolites (e.g. alkaloids synthesized in the roots of N. attenuata). These findings underscore the importance of understanding tissue-specific stress responses in the correct day-night phase context and provide a holistic framework for the important role played by roots in above-ground stress responses."

"Because soil is expected to be a major sink for engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) released to the environment, the effects of ENPs on soil processes and the organisms that carry them out should be understood. DNA-based fingerprinting analyses have shown that ENPs alter soil bacterial communities, but specific taxon changes remain unknown. We used bar-coded pyrosequencing to explore the responses of diverse bacterial taxa to two widely used ENPs, nano-TiO(2) and nano-ZnO, at various doses (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg g(-1) soil for TiO(2); 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg g(-1) soil for ZnO) in incubated soil microcosms. These ENPs significantly altered the bacterial communities in a dose-dependent manner, with some taxa increasing as a proportion of the community, but more taxa decreasing, indicating that effects mostly reduced diversity. Some of the declining taxa are known to be associated with nitrogen fixation (Rhizobiales, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and Bradyrhizobium) and methane oxidation (Methylobacteriaceae), while some positively impacted taxa are known to be associated with the decomposition of recalcitrant organic pollutants (Sphingomonadaceae) and biopolymers including protein (Streptomycetaceae and Streptomyces), indicating potential consequences to ecosystem-scale processes. The latter was suggested by a positive correlation between protease activity and the relative abundance of Streptomycetaceae (R = 0.49, P = 0.000) and Streptomyces (R = 0.47, P = 0.000). Our results demonstrate that some metal oxide nanoparticles could affect soil bacterial communities and associated processes through effects on susceptible, narrow-function bacterial taxa."

"Dyslipidemia is a major contributor to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary disease. Its role in the etiology of atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncertain.We studied 7142 men and women from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Framingham Heart Study who did not have prevalent AF at baseline and were not on lipid-lowering medications. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured using standard procedures. Incident AF during follow-up was identified from hospital discharge codes; review of medical charts; study electrocardiograms; and, in MESA only, Medicare claims. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of AF by clinical categories of blood lipids in each cohort. Study-specific results were meta-analyzed using inverse of variance weighting. During 9.6 years of mean follow-up, 480 AF cases were identified. In a combined analysis of multivariable-adjusted results from both cohorts, high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with lower AF risk (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.87 in those with levels ?60 mg/dL versus <40 mg/dL), whereas high triglycerides were associated with higher risk of AF (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.05 in those with levels ?200 mg/dL versus <150 mg/dL). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not associated with the risk of AF.In these 2 community-based cohorts, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total cholesterol were associated with the risk of AF, accounting for other cardiometabolic risk factors."

We hypothesized that such motifs might allow development of a novel approach to cancer detection. The motifs were cancer specific and achieved high classification accuracy: we found distinct motifs for breast versus colorectal cancer-associated repertoires, and the colorectal cancer motif achieved 93% accuracy, while the breast cancer motif achieved 94% accuracy. In the current study, we sought to determine whether such motifs exist for ovarian cancer, a cancer type for which detection methods are urgently needed. We made two significant advances over the prior work. First, the prior study used patient-matched TILs and healthy repertoires, collecting healthy tissue adjacent to the tumors. The current study collected TILs from patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and healthy ovary repertoires from cancer-free women undergoing hysterectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy for benign disease. Thus, the classification task is distinguishing women with cancer from women without cancer. Second, in the prior study, classification accuracy was measured by patient-hold-out cross-validation on the training data.

Classification accuracy was 95% by patient-hold-out cross-validation on the training set and 80% when the model was applied to the blinded test set. The results on the blinded test set demonstrate a biophysicochemical TCR motif found overwhelmingly in women with HGSOC but rarely in women with healthy ovaries, strengthening the proposal that cancer detection approaches might benefit from incorporation of TCR motif-based biomarkers.

We hypothesized that such motifs might allow development of a novel approach to cancer detection. The motifs were cancer specific and achieved high classification accuracy: we found distinct motifs for breast versus colorectal cancer-associated repertoires, and the colorectal cancer motif achieved 93% accuracy, while the breast cancer motif achieved 94% accuracy. In the current study, we sought to determine whether such motifs exist for ovarian cancer, a cancer type for which detection methods are urgently needed. We made two significant advances over the prior work. First, the prior study used patient-matched TILs and healthy repertoires, collecting healthy tissue adjacent to the tumors. The current study collected TILs from patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and healthy ovary repertoires from cancer-free women undergoing hysterectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy for benign disease. Thus, the classification task is distinguishing women with cancer from women without cancer.

To explore these issues, we compared 20 different sampling designs in equilibrium (i.e. island model and isolation by distance) and nonequilibrium (i.e. range expansion from one or two refugia) demographic histories in spatially heterogeneous environments. We simulated spatially complex landscapes, which allowed us to exploit local maxima and minima in the environment in 'pair' and 'transect' sampling strategies. We compared FST outlier and genetic–environment association (GEA) methods for each of two approaches that control for population structure: with a covariance matrix or with latent factors. We show that while the relative power of two methods in the same category (FST or GEA) depended largely on the number of individuals sampled, overall GEA tests had higher power in the island model and FST had higher power under isolation by distance. In the refugia models, however, these methods varied in their power to detect local adaptation at weakly selected loci. At weakly selected loci, paired sampling designs had equal or higher power than transect or random designs to detect local adaptation.

81	ZENODO_4768438	Zenodo	Memory extinction and spontaneous recovery shaping parasitoid foraging behavior	"Animals can alter their foraging behavior through associative learning, where an encounter with an essential resource (e.g. food or a reproductive opportunity) is associated with nearby environmental cues (e.g. volatiles). This can subsequently improve the animal's foraging efficiency. However, when these associated cues are encountered again, the anticipated resource is not always present. Such an unrewarding experience, also called a memory-extinction experience, can change an animal's response to the associated cues. Although some studies are available on the mechanisms of this process, they rarely focus on cues and rewards that are relevant in an animal's natural habitat. In this study, we tested the effect of different types of ecologically relevant memory-extinction experiences on the conditioned plant volatile preferences of the parasitic wasp Cotesia glomerata that uses these cues to locate its caterpillar hosts. These extinction experiences consisted of contact with only host traces (frass and silk), contact with non-host traces or an oviposition in a non-host near host traces, on the conditioned plant species. Our results show that the lack of an oviposition, after contacting host traces, led to the temporary alteration of the conditioned plant volatile preference in C. glomerata, but this effect was plant species-specific. These results provide novel insights in how ecologically relevant memory-extinction experiences can fine-tune an animal's foraging behavior. This fine-tuning of learned behavior can be beneficial when the lack of finding a resource accurately predicts current, but not future foraging opportunities. Such continuous re-evaluation of obtained information helps animals to prevent maladaptive foraging behavior."	Associative learning

81	ZENODO_4768438	Zenodo	Memory extinction and spontaneous recovery shaping parasitoid foraging behavior	"Animals can alter their foraging behavior through associative learning, where an encounter with an essential resource (e.g. food or a reproductive opportunity) is associated with nearby environmental cues (e.g. volatiles). This can subsequently improve the animal's foraging efficiency. However, when these associated cues are encountered again, the anticipated resource is not always present. Such an unrewarding experience, also called a memory-extinction experience, can change an animal's response to the associated cues. Although some studies are available on the mechanisms of this process, they rarely focus on cues and rewards that are relevant in an animal's natural habitat. In this study, we tested the effect of different types of ecologically relevant memory-extinction experiences on the conditioned plant volatile preferences of the parasitic wasp Cotesia glomerata that uses these cues to locate its caterpillar hosts. These extinction experiences consisted of contact with only host traces (frass and silk), contact with non-host traces or an oviposition in a non-host near host traces, on the conditioned plant species. Our results show that the lack of an oviposition, after contacting host traces, led to the temporary alteration of the conditioned plant volatile preference in C. glomerata, but this effect was plant species-specific. These results provide novel insights in how ecologically relevant memory-extinction experiences can fine-tune an animal's foraging behavior.

However, the importance of these nutrients to plant growth and reproductive effort is not well understood. Here, we evaluate the relationship between the communities that colonize pitcher plant phytotelmata and the pitcher plants' vegetative growth and flower production to better understand the symbiotic role played by phytotelma communities. We focus on the mountain variety purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea var. montana), which occurs in small and isolated populations in Western North Carolina. We found that greater symbiont community diversity is associated with higher flower production the following season. We then examined geographic variation in communities and found that smaller plant populations supported less diverse symbiont communities. We relate our observations to patterns of community diversity predicted by community ecology theory."	Field sampling

It is estimated that 3.2 million people are infected with schistosomiasis in Niger. Mass drug administration (MDA) with the drug praziquantel is the mainstay of schistosomiasis control.              Existing thresholds for implementation of mass treatment for schistosomiasis needed refinement and a better evidence base to establish the relative benefits of different age-group coverage formats and different schedules of targeted mass praziquantel delivery. There was interest in finding out whether, when compared with school-based treatment, using one or more years of community-wide treatment would have a greater impact on the prevalence and intensity of infection if, for example, community-wide treatment could achieve better coverage of school-aged children who did not attend school or better coverage of high-risk adults. There also was a lack of data as to whether every-other-year delivery of MDA could be sufficient for morbidity control.         Objectives: The primary research question addressed in this study is which MDA strategy- annual versus biannual school-based treatment or community-wide treatment - provided the greatest reduction in prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection among 9-12 year-olds after four years of intervention. In addition, the impact of treatment on first-year students and adults was also assessed.        Methodology  Study Sites: The study was conducted in 225 villages in nine districts in Western Niger along the Niger River Valley- the region of Tillabery (Kollo, Say, Tera, Filingué and Tillabery districts), Dosso (Loga district) and Niamey (districts 1-3).        Dates of Data Collection: 2011- 2015        Study Design: Cluster-randomized trial        Data Collection  Sampling: A total of 225 villages were enrolled in the study, with 100 children aged 9-12 years tested each year per village. In addition, systematic random sampling was used in each village to select a further 100 first-year students (aged 5-8 years) in all 225 villages at the first and fifth years only. A convenience sample of 50 adults (aged 22-50 years) were sampled in the first and last year of villages with a starting S. haematobium prevalence over 25%.       Village-level data: Data was collected from each study village on geographic location (latitude, longitude) and data related to MDA coverage- total village population, population treated by MDA, number of school-aged children, number of school-aged children treated by MDA. Individual-level data: Demographic data on age and sex was collected from each participant. A single urine sample was collected from each individual in the study for assessment of the S. haematobium egg burden by urine filtration and microscopy.         ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as cleaned .csv files with all personal identifiers removed. All dates were obfuscated per individual through the application of a random number algorithm that shifted dates no more than seven days to comply with the ethical conduct of human subjects research.

The purpose of the study was explained to education and health authorities. All results in the datasets were anonymous and coded to prevent association with the individual participant.        Last Updated: March 8, 2021To provide an evidence base for cost-effective schistosomiasis control, a five-year study cluster-randomised trial in Niger investigated six possible combinations of annual or biannual community-wide treatment, school-based treatment, and holidays from mass treatment over four years. The primary outcome of interest was prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma haematobium among 100 children aged 9-12 years sampled each year in each village. The relative reduction of prevalence was greater in biannual compared with annual treatment across all arms; however, the only significant difference was seen in areas with a high starting prevalence."

3	clinepidb_DS_4d0fe88b6b	ClinEpiDB	SCORE Niger S. haematobium Cluster Randomized Trial	"Related studies:   SCORE Mozambique S. haematobium Cluster Randomized Trial SCORE S. mansoni Cluster Randomized Trial    Background:  Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. It is estimated that 3.2 million people are infected with schistosomiasis in Niger. Mass drug administration (MDA) with the drug praziquantel is the mainstay of schistosomiasis control.              Existing thresholds for implementation of mass treatment for schistosomiasis needed refinement and a better evidence base to establish the relative benefits of different age-group coverage formats and different schedules of targeted mass praziquantel delivery. There was interest in finding out whether, when compared with school-based treatment, using one or more years of community-wide treatment would have a greater impact on the prevalence and intensity of infection if, for example, community-wide treatment could achieve better coverage of school-aged children who did not attend school or better coverage of high-risk adults. There also was a lack of data as to whether every-other-year delivery of MDA could be sufficient for morbidity control.         Objectives: The primary research question addressed in this study is which MDA strategy- annual versus biannual school-based treatment or community-wide treatment - provided the greatest reduction in prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection among 9-12 year-olds after four years of intervention. In addition, the impact of treatment on first-year students and adults was also assessed.        Methodology  Study Sites: The study was conducted in 225 villages in nine districts in Western Niger along the Niger River Valley- the region of Tillabery (Kollo, Say, Tera, Filingué and Tillabery districts), Dosso (Loga district) and Niamey (districts 1-3).        Dates of Data Collection: 2011- 2015        Study Design: Cluster-randomized trial        Data Collection  Sampling: A total of 225 villages were enrolled in the study, with 100 children aged 9-12 years tested each year per village. In addition, systematic random sampling was used in each village to select a further 100 first-year students (aged 5-8 years) in all 225 villages at the first and fifth years only. A convenience sample of 50 adults (aged 22-50 years) were sampled in the first and last year of villages with a starting S. haematobium prevalence over 25%.       Village-level data: Data was collected from each study village on geographic location (latitude, longitude) and data related to MDA coverage- total village population, population treated by MDA, number of school-aged children, number of school-aged children treated by MDA. Individual-level data: Demographic data on age and sex was collected from each participant. A single urine sample was collected from each individual in the study for assessment of the S. haematobium egg burden by urine filtration and microscopy.         ClinEpiDB Data Integration: Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as cleaned .csv files with all personal identifiers removed. All dates were obfuscated per individual through the application of a random number algorithm that shifted dates no more than seven days to comply with the ethical conduct of human subjects research.

"Extracellular matrix (ECM) is the protein- and polysaccharide-rich backbone of bacterial biofilms that provides a defensive barrier in clinical, environmental and industrial settings. Understanding the dynamics of biofilm formation in native environments has been hindered by a lack of research tools. Here we report a method for simultaneous, real-time, in situ detection and differentiation of the Salmonella ECM components curli and cellulose, using non-toxic, luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs). These flexible conjugated polymers emit a conformation-dependent fluorescence spectrum, which we use to kinetically define extracellular appearance of curli fibres and cellulose polysaccharides during bacterial growth. The scope of this technique is demonstrated by defining biofilm morphotypes of Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium, and their isogenic mutants in liquid culture and on solid media, and by visualising the ECM components in native biofilms. Our reported use of LCOs across a number of platforms, including intracellular cellulose production in eukaryotic cells and in infected tissues, demonstrates the versatility of this optotracing technology, and its ability to redefine biofilm research."

57	VDJ_BIOPROJECT:PRJNA639580	VDJServer	Imbalance of Regulatory and Cytotoxic SARS-CoV-2-Reactive CD4 + T Cells in COVID-19	"The contribution of CD4+ T cells to protective or pathogenic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. Here, we present single-cell transcriptomic analysis of >100,000 viral antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from 40 COVID-19 patients. In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper cells and cytotoxic T helper (TH) cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2 and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (TREG). Importantly, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a strong cytotoxic TFH response was observed early in the illness, which correlated negatively with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

In low Human Development Index settings, it ranks second. Screening and surveillance involve the cytology-based Papanicolaou (Pap) test and testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV). The Pap test has low sensitivity to detect precursor lesions, while a single hrHPV test cannot distinguish a persistent infection from one that the immune system will naturally clear. Furthermore, among women who are hrHPV-positive and progress to high-grade cervical lesions, testing cannot identify the ~20% who would progress to cancer if not treated. Thus, reliable detection and treatment of cancers and precancers requires routine screening followed by frequent surveillance among those with past abnormal or positive results. The consequence is overtreatment, with its associated risks and complications, in screened populations and an increased risk of cancer in under-screened populations. Methods to improve cervical cancer risk assessment, particularly assays to predict regression of precursor lesions or clearance of hrHPV infection, would benefit both populations. Here we show that women who have lower risk results on follow-up testing relative to index testing have evidence of enhanced T cell clonal expansion in the index cervical cytology sample compared to women who persist with higher risk results from index to follow-up. We further show that a machine learning classifier based on the index sample T cells predicts this transition to lower risk with 95% accuracy (19/20) by leave-one-out cross-validation. Using T cell receptor deep sequencing and machine learning, we identified a biophysicochemical motif in the complementarity-determining region 3 of T cell receptor β chains whose presence predicts this transition. While these results must still be tested on an independent cohort in a prospective study, they suggest that this approach could improve cervical cancer screening by helping distinguish women likely to spontaneously regress from those at elevated risk of progression to cancer. The advancement of such a strategy could reduce surveillance frequency and overtreatment in screened populations and improve the delivery of screening to under-screened populations.  We included samples from White Hispanic women age 18 years or older. We excluded women who were HIV+, pregnant, had an intrauterine device, or had a sexually transmitted disease at the time of sample collection. We obtained samples across all cytology result categories: Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy (NILM, Normal), Abnormal Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS), Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL), and High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL). At Parkland Health and Hospital System (PHHS), the primary screening strategy is cytology alone with a reflex hrHPV test for women with an ASCUS cytology result. The test assays for positivity across 14 HPV types, and the ASCUS result category is divided into ASCUS/HPV- (negative for all 14 types) and ASCUS/HPV+ (positive for at least one type). An additional exclusion criterion was applied to women with a result of Normal, ASCUS/HPV-, and ASCUS/HPV+, and that is they were excluded if they had previously had cervical cancer or previous treatment of cervical pre-cancerous lesions.  We applied these inclusion and exclusion criteria in a quota sampling scheme to ensure adequate representation of women across all five result categories. We targeted a minimum of 100 samples total with a minimum of 15 samples in each category, and then rescued all samples meeting our criteria each week until all minimums were reached.

We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumor tissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity.
