    "description": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled regimen optimization trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and protective efficacy in healthy Equatoguinean men and women age 18-45 years of an attenuated whole Pf sporozoite (SPZ) malaria vaccine (Sanaria\u00ae PfSPZ Vaccine) administered by direct venous inoculation (DVI). PfSPZ Vaccine, which is composed of aseptic, purified, live (metabolically active), radiation-attenuated, cryopreserved PfSPZ, will be administered according to 4 different regimens, focusing on condensed regimens 4 weeks or less in duration. Should these condensed regimens prove to be as safe and efficacious as a gold standard 16-week regimen when evaluated in this trial, they will be adopted preferentially for further development based on improved feasibility for any purpose: immunizing children and adults in endemic areas, immunizing prior to travel, immunizing whole populations in mass vaccination programs (MVPs), or immunizing women to protect against pregnancy malaria. In each of these circumstances, rapid immunization regimens would offer a distinct advantage. The first of the 4 regimens to be tested is a standard 16-week regimen that consists of a 4-dose priming series (injections on Days 1, 3, 5, 7) and a 16 -week boost. This regimen is identical to a highly protective regimen studied in a prior trial performed in malaria-na\u00efve adults (Warfighter 2 trial), except that the number of PfSPZ injected per dose (4.5x105 PfSPZ in Warfighter 2) has been increased to 9.0x105 PfSPZ for the current trial in Equatorial Guinea. A dose of 9.0x105 PfSPZ has been selected because this dose was highly protective in the BSPZV2 trial conducted in Tanzania. It is also selected because of the presence of naturally acquired immunity (NAI) in the Equatoguinean study population. As shown in prior studies in Africa, prior exposure to malaria in Africans is associated with reduced PfSPZ Vaccine immunogenicity, and to compensate, a somewhat higher dose of PfSPZ is likely required, compared to what may be optimal in malaria na\u00efve individuals. This 16-week regimen was the most protective among four different 16-week regimens evaluated in the Warfighter 2 trial. It is thought that the multiple dose prime is the main reason for improved efficacy. In the current study, this gold standard regimen will be compared to three condensed regimens: one with the same 4-dose prime as the 16-week regimen, but with a 28 day (as opposed to 16 week) interval prior to boost; one with the same 4-dose prime and no boost; and one where only two immunizations are used as the prime (Days 1, 7) followed by a 28 day interval boost. The efficacy of each regimen will be evaluated against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) performed at 8 weeks after immunization. CHMI will be done by injecting a second whole PfSPZ product manufactured by Sanaria: PfSPZ Challenge. PfSPZ Challenge is identical to PfSPZ Vaccine, except the PfSPZ have not been attenuated by irradiation, and therefore are fully infectious. Both PfSPZ Challenge and PfSPZ Vaccine are derived from the NF54 strain of Pf; therefore the CHMIs to be performed in this study will be considered homologous. The overall objective of the trial is to collect data on safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and protection that indicate the best regimen(s) for further development. While the trial is not powered for a formal statistical comparison between the 4 regimens, it will provide important guidance for down-selection. The 4 regimens are: 1. 9.0x105 PfSPZ administered four times on Days 1, 3, 5 and 7 (0, +2, +4, +6 days) as a prime, followed by a boost of 9.0x105 PfSPZ on Day 113 (+16 weeks) (as described above, this is similar to a standard, protective regimen from the Warfighter 2 trial, and will serve as a comparator) 2. 9.0x105 PfSPZ administered four times on Days 1, 3, 5 and 7 (0, +2, +4, +6 days) as a prime, without a boost (to evaluate whether a boost is needed) 3. 9.0x105 PfSPZ administered four times on Days 1, 3, 5 and 7 (0, +2, +4, +6 days) as a prime, followed by a boost of 9.0x105 PfSPZ on Day 29 (+4 weeks) (same as 1, but the interval to the boost is significantly shortened) 4. 9.0x105 PfSPZ administered two times on Days 1 and 8 (0, +7 days) as a prime, followed by a boost of 9.0x105 PfSPZ on Day 29 (+4 weeks) (same as 3, but assesses whether 2 priming immunizations are enough; previously studied in the MAVACHE trial in Germany) The safety and tolerability of each regimen will be measured by recording (1) solicited and unsolicited adverse events, (2) immunogenicity by assessing humoral and cellular immune responses pre- and post-vaccination, and (3) vaccine efficacy (VE) by measuring protection against homologous CHMI administered by DVI of PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) at 8 weeks post-final vaccination.",
